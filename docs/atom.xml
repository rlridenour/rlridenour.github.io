  <title>How Autocrats Destroy Truth</title>

 <p>
I’ve often wondered why the administration continues to make claims that are laughably and provably false, such as Trump’s claim that one of his prominent critics, Gov. Wes Moore of Maryland called him “the greatest president of my lifetime.”
</p>

 <p>
Anne Applebaum writing for  <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/06/china-russia-republican-party-relations/678271/"> <i>The Atlantic</i></a>:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
This tactic—the so-called fire hose of falsehoods—ultimately produces not outrage but nihilism. Given so many explanations, how can you know what actually happened? What if you just can’t know? If you don’t know what happened, you’re not likely to join a great movement for democracy, or to listen when anyone speaks about positive political change. Instead, you are not going to participate in any politics at all.
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
The country is gathering into large groups — the gullible true believers who believe everything and the cynical skeptics who believe nothing. Those in the former group obviously serve the interests of the powers that be by their unreflective support. Those in the latter also serve the interests of the ruling powers with their despairing malaise.  It’s in the interests of the autocrats to ensure that, if you can’t be one of the gullibile, you at least become a nihilist.
</p>

 <p>
Seek the truth, hold on to hope, keep the faith.

  <title>Creating Attendance Sheets with Org Mode</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <h1 class="title">Creating Attendance Sheets with Org Mode
 <br></br> <span class="subtitle">Aug 23, 2025 18:03</span>
</h1>
 <p>
I do not like taking attendance in class. Unfortunately, despite having paid very much to take the course, many students need the extra motivation to attend class. My Introduction to Philosophy classes average 35 students which makes calling every student by name more time-consuming than I would like. If I could remember names, I could take attendance quickly, but unfortunately, names have always been a problem for me. <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> The best thing for me to do is to pass around a sign-in sheet.
</p>

 <p>
Even though I’ve written almost everything in Org mode for over a decade now, I have always done these attendance sheets in a word processor. The problem is that the number of students enrolled would vary from semester to semester, and fitting everything into one page required adjusting column widths, row heights, etc., and it always  <i>seemed</i> easier to do this in a word processor. This was only because I’ve never really done much with LaTeX tables. Finally, last semester, I decided to figure out how to make them in Org. It won’t be surprising to Emacs users that, in the end, it was far easier than using the word processor.
</p>

 <p>
Just declare the  <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/tabularray?lang=en">tabularray</a> package in the LaTeX header like this:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-org"> <code> <span class="org-org-meta-line">#+LaTeX_HEADER: \usepackage{tabularray}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

 <p>
In the body, insert the table formatting codes <sup> <a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> and the Org table. Here’s a sample with names from  <a href="https://1000randomnames.com">1000randomnames.com</a>:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-org"> <code> <span class="org-org-meta-line">#+ATTR_LATEX: :environment tblr :align hline{3-Z}={solid},row{2-Z}={f,10mm},colspec={XXXX}</span>
 <span class="org-org-table">| </span> <span class="org-org-table"> <span class="org-bold">Name</span></span> <span class="org-org-table">             | </span> <span class="org-org-table"> <span class="org-bold">Signature</span></span> <span class="org-org-table"> | </span> <span class="org-org-table"> <span class="org-bold">Name</span></span> <span class="org-org-table">           | </span> <span class="org-org-table"> <span class="org-bold">Signature</span></span> <span class="org-org-table"> |</span> <span class="org-org-table-row">
</span> <span class="org-org-table">| Branch, Kassidy  |           | Graves, Amaya  |           |</span> <span class="org-org-table-row">
</span> <span class="org-org-table">| Duffy, Keenan    |           | Gentry, Micah |           |</span> <span class="org-org-table-row">
</span> <span class="org-org-table">| Fischer, Addisyn |           | Kaur, Amelie   |           |</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

 <p>
Creating the table was still a slight pain. It involved pasting a column of names, then inserting the pipe character at the beginning of every line in the top half of the column, two pipe characters at the end of each line, then killing the bottom half of the column and inserting it as a rectangle at the right side of the top half. It wasn’t difficult using  <code>query-replace-regexp</code> and a couple of rectangle operations, but even the slightly tedious task that will be repeated indefinitely is worth automating.
</p>

 <p>
There were two parts that were tricky for me. The first was splitting the list at the correct row. If there were 34 students, then I needed two groups of 17 with the second group starting at row 18, but a class of 35 students required one group of 18 and another of 17 with the second group starting at row 19. I wanted the left column to be the larger for aesthetic reasons, and didn’t want to manually determine where to split the list. I solved it by first counting the lines in the list, then adding the remainder of a division by 2. This resulted in 34 for the class of 34, since dividing an even number has a remainder of 0, and 36 for the class of 35. I then divided that result in 2 and added 1, giving me the 18 and 19 respectively that I needed.
</p>

 <p>
The second tricky part was the pasting the lines from the second half to the ends of the lines in the first half. The fortunate thing about using an editor as old as Emacs is that almost every conceivable question has been asked and answered online. That was fortunate for me, because I’m not sure I would have ever figured it out.  You’ll see a few lines in the code below that split the last item in the kill-ring at line-breaks, and insert each resulting sub-string at the end of each line.
</p>

 <p>
The rest is just inserting the characters to make it an Org table, killing an extra line, putting the columns in order, and inserting the LaTeX headers with a snippet. Here’s the result, with the usual disclaimer about my being an incompetent amateur and so on:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-elisp"> <code>( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">create-roll-sheet</span> ()
  ( <span class="org-keyword">interactive</span>)
   <span class="org-comment-delimiter">;; </span> <span class="org-comment">Append signature cells to each line.
</span>  (goto-char (point-min))
  (replace-regexp  <span class="org-string">"$"</span>  <span class="org-string">" |  | "</span>)
   <span class="org-comment-delimiter">;; </span> <span class="org-comment">kill bottom half of buffer and move to top
</span>  ( <span class="org-keyword">setq</span> lines (count-lines (point-min) (point-max)))
  ( <span class="org-keyword">setq</span> lines (+ lines (% lines 2) ))
  ( <span class="org-keyword">setq</span> midpoint (+ (/ lines 2) 1))
  (goto-line midpoint)
  (kill-region (point) (point-max))
  (beginning-of-buffer)
   <span class="org-comment-delimiter">;; </span> <span class="org-comment">Append each line from kill-ring to remaining lines.
</span>  ( <span class="org-keyword">dolist</span> (cur-line-to-insert (split-string (current-kill 0)  <span class="org-string">"\n"</span>))
    ( <span class="org-keyword">if</span> (eobp)
        (newline)
      (move-end-of-line nil))
    (insert cur-line-to-insert)
    (forward-line))
   <span class="org-comment-delimiter">;; </span> <span class="org-comment">Prepend pipe character to each line and kill last line.
</span>  (goto-char (point-min))
  (replace-regexp  <span class="org-string">"^"</span>  <span class="org-string">"| "</span>)
  (kill-whole-line)
   <span class="org-comment-delimiter">;; </span> <span class="org-comment">insert LaTeX table format and header lines
</span>  (goto-char (point-min))
  (insert  <span class="org-string">"#+ATTR_LATEX: :environment tblr :align hline{3-Z}={solid},row{2-Z}={f,10mm},colspec={XXXX}\n| *Name*              | *Signature* | *Name*              | *Signature* | \n"</span>)
   <span class="org-comment-delimiter">;; </span> <span class="org-comment">Clean up table.
</span>  (org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c)
   <span class="org-comment-delimiter">;; </span> <span class="org-comment">Insert LaTeX header.
</span>  (goto-char (point-min))
  (yas-expand-snippet (yas-lookup-snippet  <span class="org-string">"roll-sheet"</span>)))
</code></pre>
</div>

 <p>
It’s 31 lines of code, but it wasn’t difficult. In fact, it took longer to write this blog post than to write the function. 
</p>

 <p>
To be honest, this is something that I only have to do maybe twice a semester. So, why bother? It’s fun and I get a sense of satisfaction from doing it, and that’s reason enough in itself. Still, there is good reason to automate something that you only rarely have to do. I think there are two kinds of tasks that deserve to be automated. The first is something involving several steps that you have to do constantly. The second is something involving several steps that you only do rarely, but since it’s done only rarely, it’s difficult to remember how it was accomplished previously. This task probably fits into neither category, but I still learned something about Elisp that I’m sure will be useful when have a problem that does.

  <title>A Franciscan Blessing</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <h1 class="title">A Franciscan Blessing
 <br></br> <span class="subtitle">Aug 17, 2025 19:36</span>
</h1>
 <p>
This is often called “A Franciscan Blessing.”
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
May God bless you with discomfort, <br></br>
at easy answers, half-truths, <br></br>
and superficial relationships <br></br>
so that you may live <br></br>
deep within your heart.
</p>

 <p>
May God bless you with anger <br></br>
at injustice, oppression, <br></br>
and exploitation of people, <br></br>
so that you may work for <br></br>
justice, freedom and peace.
</p>

 <p>
May God bless you with tears, <br></br>
to shed for those who suffer pain, <br></br>
rejection, hunger, and war, <br></br>
so that you may reach out your hand <br></br>
to comfort them and <br></br>
to turn their pain to joy.
</p>

 <p>
And may God bless you <br></br>
with enough foolishness <br></br>
to believe that you can <br></br>
make a difference in the world, <br></br>
so that you can do <br></br>
what others claim cannot be done, <br></br>
to bring justice and kindness <br></br>
to all our children and the poor.
</p>

 <p>
Amen
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
 <a href="https://www.thesacredbraid.com/2016/07/22/a-non-traditional-blessing/">Dan Miller</a> traced it to Sister Ruth Fox, OSB, who was kind of enough to share with him her original version:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
 <b>A Non-traditional Blessing</b>
</p>

 <p>
May God bless you with discontent with easy answers, half-truths, superficial relationships, so that you will live from deep within your heart.
</p>

 <p>
May God bless you with anger at injustice, oppression, abuse, and exploitation of people, so that you will work for justice, equality, and  peace.
</p>

 <p>
May God bless you with tears to shed for those who suffer from pain, rejection, starvation and war, so that you will reach out your hand to comfort  them and to change their pain to joy.
</p>

 <p>
May God bless you with the foolishness to think you can make a difference in this world, so that you will do the things which others tell you cannot be done.
</p>

 <p>
If you have the courage to accept these blessings, then God will also bless you with:
</p>

 <p>
happiness—because you will know that you have made life better for others
</p>

 <p>
inner peace—because you will have worked to secure an outer peace for others
</p>

 <p>
laughter—because your heart will be light
</p>

 <p>
faithful friends—because they will recognize your worth as a person.
</p>

 <p>
These blessings are yours—not for the asking, but for the giving—from One who wants to be your companion, our God, who lives and reigns, forever and ever. Amen.
</p>

 <p>
This is my post for this month’s  <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Carnival">Emacs Carnival</a>, “Your Elevator Pitch for Emacs.” 
</p>

 <p>
It’s very simple. There is one thing that I have  <i>never</i> heard an Emacs user say:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
I’m forced to use Emacs for this particular task, but I sure wish I could use something else.
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
Why would you not want to at least  <i>try</i> something that its users love that much?

  <title>Inserting Bible Passages With Emacs</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <h1 class="title">Inserting Bible Passages With Emacs
 <br></br> <span class="subtitle">Aug 10, 2025 15:23</span>
</h1>
 <p>
Much of my writing requires quoting biblical passages, which always involved opening another application, searching for the passage, copying and pasting, then cleaning up the pasted text. Here is a function that I now use to automate the process in Emacs. My preferred translation is the New Revised Standard Version, which is available online using the  <a href="https://bible.oremus.org">oremus Bible Browser</a>. They have a convenient API which is documented  <a href="https://bible.oremus.org/api.html">here</a>. The function asks for a passage reference, formats the inputted string properly for the API, retrieves the passage, strips the HTML, then inserts the resulting plain text. The passage can either be an entire chapter or selected verses from a chapter. If preferred, The book name can be abbreviated using the standard abbreviations. 
</p>

 <p>
Here is the function:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"> <code>( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">nrsv-insert-passage</span> ()

  ( <span class="org-keyword">setq</span> oremus-link (concat  <span class="org-string">"https://bible.oremus.org/?version=NRSV&passage="</span> oremus-passage  <span class="org-string">"&vnum=NO&fnote=NO&omithidden=YES"</span>))
  (switch-to-buffer (url-retrieve-synchronously oremus-link))

  (kill-region (point) 1)

    (replace-match  <span class="org-string">"\""</span>))
  (beginning-of-buffer)
  ( <span class="org-keyword">while</span> (re-search-forward  <span class="org-string">"&#145;"</span> nil t)

  (delete-extra-blank-lines)
  (clipboard-kill-ring-save (point-min) (point-max))
  (kill-buffer)
  (yank))
</code></pre>
</div>

 <p>
If another translation is preferred, there are other sites that also have API’s. I have to add my usual disclaimer — I really don’t know what I’m doing; I just keep messing with it until I get the result I wanted. Surely, there are more elegant ways of solving the problem, and I’d welcome hearing about them. This is definitely the sort of thing that will be useful to only a handful of people in the world, if that. It is, however, an example of how useful Emacs can be, even for those of us non-programming types.

 <br></br> <span class="subtitle">Jul 28, 2025 13:44</span>
</h1>
 <p>
I’ve enjoyed reading the posts in this month’s  <a href="https://gregnewman.io/blog/emacs-carnival-2025-07-writing-experience/">Emacs Carnival</a> on the topic of “Writing Experience.” It’s given me an opportunity to reflect not only on how I use Emacs to write, but also on why I continue to use Emacs despite the many alternatives that are available. I don’t consider myself to be the typical Emacs user, if there is such a person. I’m certainly not a coder; anything I learned in my single FORTRAN class thirty-five years ago is long gone by now. <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> Instead, I’m a philosophy professor at a small liberal arts university, which means that I live in a Microsoft world. It’s very likely that I am the only Emacs user on campus. I’m also a retired Army Reserve chaplain. I’m sure that Emacs users are a minority in technical fields, but they are almost non-existent in the humanities. One can only imagine how few Emacs users there are in ministry.
</p>

 <p>
Everything that I produced during my undergraduate and graduate studies, including my dissertation,  was written with a word processor, either WordPerfect 5.1 or MS Word 6.0. As I began working more with formal logic, I began to be aware of the power and beautiful output of LaTeX, and that led me to look for the best way to edit LaTeX files. It turns out that there’s no agreement on the internet for the best way to do anything, so my search let me down many paths.  In 2012, I wrote a blog post about my experience, titled “ <a href="https://randyridenour.net/posts/2012-05-24-a-sordid-tale-of-text-editors.html">A Sordid Tale of Text Editors</a>.” It documents a journey from TextMate to Vim, a brief interlude with Emacs, then back to TextMate, then to Sublime Text 2. <sup> <a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> What I now find particularly interesting about that post are the three reasons why I rejected Emacs at the time:
</p>

 <ol class="org-ol"> <li>The complex, arcane key combinations,</li>
 <li>The inability to use Textexpander snippets in Gnu Emacs, and</li>
 <li>The pain of configuring Emacs for amateurs.</li>
</ol> <p>
The second no longer applies — at the time, Emacs just wasn’t a well-behaved Mac app, but that has changed over the years. The first and third, though, are still common reasons that people cite for giving up Emacs. Shortly after I wrote that, however, I gave Emacs another try, and over a decade later, I’m still using it. More that that, though, I can’t imagine an alternative.
</p>

 <p>
The mistake that I made in my earlier flirtation with Emacs was, in my opinion, treating it as just another text editor. Every other text editor that I tried demanded that I conform to  its way of editing. When I realized that Emacs, with a bit of configuration work, was quite willing to conform to the way that I wanted to work, the search was over. Don’t like the keybindings? Then change them! Prefer modal editing? Emacs can do that. Do you want a file tree window to the side as with VSCode? Emacs can do that, too. The initialization files may look complicated at first, but Lisp is very straightforward and remarkably easy to follow, even for a philosopher like me. When I got stuck, I found the community to be remarkably gracious and helpful.
</p>

 <p>
I do write some papers for presentation and possible publication, but our primary responsibility as faculty at my institution is teaching. So, most of my writing is for lecture notes, presentation slides, and handouts. Given our heavy teaching load (normally four courses per semester), it helps to be able to produce these as efficiently as possible. With Emacs, I’m able to write one document and, from that, produce a PDF of notes for me, slides to show in class, and and HTML handout to post in the learning management system. In short, a function creates four files: one that exports a notes PDF for me, one that exports to a LaTeX Beamer document, one that exports to HTML for posting, and a data file used by the other three. The Org headers are automatically inserted into each file, and the only file that I actually edit is the data file. Two Yasnippet snippets make it easy to specify text that appears only in the presenter’s notes in the slides and more detailed notes that appear in the lecture notes. The HTML handout includes everything in the lecture notes. An export function generates the HTML and copies it to the clipboard for pasting to the LMS. (The code for everything is in the  <a href="https://github.com/rlridenour/emacs-elpaca-config?tab=readme-ov-file#teaching">teaching</a> section of my configuration file.)
</p>

 <p>
I use many packages, but there are some that are particularly useful for my everyday writing. 
</p>

 <ul class="org-ul"> <li> <a href="https://github.com/minad/jinx">Jinx</a> for spell checking.</li>
 <li>I’ve already mentioned  <a href="https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet">Yasnippet</a>. I also find  <a href="https://github.com/Kungsgeten/yankpad">Yankpad</a> can be useful for inserting snippets that are used only occasionally.</li>
 <li> <a href="https://github.com/aaronjensen/emacs-orgonomic">Orgonomic</a> helps me quickly enter lists and headings in Org mode.</li>
 <li> <a href="https://github.com/oantolin/math-delimiters">Math-Delimiters</a> for quickly entering LaTeX math mode.</li>
 <li> <a href="https://github.com/emacs-citar/citar">Citar</a> makes citations simple.</li>
</ul> <p>
Finally, I should point out that I can’t use Emacs for everything. Although everything begins in Org mode, some of it must, unfortunately, end up in Microsoft Word. I have a collaborative book project with a colleague who only uses Word, and most publishers in the humanities, including those in my particular fields of philosophy and religion, expect Word documents. That’s no problem, provided that I am the sole author. Any changes can be made to the original Org document, with a final export to a docx file. If I’m collaborating with someone else, then eventually I just have to start working in Word.
</p>

 <p>
In the end, the best thing about the Emacs writing experience is that there is no such thing as  <i>the</i> Emacs writing experience. Emacs provides a canvas and tools from which each user crafts their own editing environment. Simple or complex, modal or non-modal, Emacs can provide the writing experience you want, not merely something that just approximates it. That’s why I’m still using it.

  <title>A Sordid Tale of Text Editors</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <h1 class="title">A Sordid Tale of Text Editors
 <br></br> <span class="subtitle">May 24, 2012 00:00</span>
</h1>
 <p>
For years now, It seems like I have been searching for the perfect text editor. Evidently, there are those who believe that there is one single perfect text editor for everyone. If you need evidence, just search the Internet for “Vim vs. Emacs.” My experience, though, leads to me believe that, when it comes to text editors, like many other tools, perfection is relative to the individual. What tool is needed depends on how the individual writer works and thinks.
</p>

 <p>
I used word processors (beginning with WordPerfect 5.1, which I still think is the best, it’s been all downhill for word processors ever since) until I started writing LaTeX documents. I began with TeXShop, which comes bundled with  <a href="http://www.tug.org/mactex/2011/">MacTeX</a>. TeXShop is an excellent resource for writing LaTeX. It’s free, powerful, and I recommend it with no reservations at all.
</p>

 <p>
I don’t know why I began experimenting with other editors. I surely didn’t need any other editor to edit LaTeX. It may have been when I started writing in  <a href="http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/">MultiMarkdown</a> (MMD). Markdown, created by John Gruber, is a simple way to produce very readable documents and convert them to HTML. Markdown has grown in popularity recently, resulting in an abundance of simple Markdown editors for both OS X and iOS. I can’t remember what year I stumbled on it, but at some point I discovered Fletcher Penney’s MultiMarkdown. MultiMarkdown adds some features to Markdown, including tables and footnotes, among other things. The most important feature for me, though, was the ability to convert the document to both HTML and to LaTeX. So, I started writing in MultiMarkdown, which then gave me the ability to export the same document in several formats as needed. I could have used TeXShop to write MMD, but it wasn’t the best experience.
</p>

 <p>
At the time, there was a great deal of excitement about  <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>. After watching some videos on YouTube showing LaTeX editing with TextMate, I was hooked. Then, I discovered that Fletcher Penney himself had produced a Markdown bundle for TextMate. So, I could use TextMate to easily edit an MMD document, with a quick keyboard shortcut, convert it to a LaTeX file, touch up any TeX code, then build the PDF, all from within TextMate.
</p>

 <p>
But then, I started hearing things about Vim. So, I downloaded  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/">MacVim</a>, and then spent a great deal of time learning the Vim commands and configuring my .vimrc. In my opinion, navigating files in Vim is pure magic, and I don’t think that there is anything better for editing, that is, making small corrections to an existing document.
</p>

 <p>
Although I understand Vim, and can use it competently, it never quite fit the way that I work. Vim is a modal editor, which means that different modes are used for different things. For instance, insert mode is for inserting text. <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> Normal mode is used for navigating the document, among other things. The beauty of Vim is how much one can do with very few keystrokes. For instance, pressing  <code>dd</code> deletes a sentence, and  <code>2dd</code> deletes two sentences. Vim experts look like sorcerers at the keyboard. Unfortunately, Vim just never quite fit for me as a tool to write longer documents, I still use it in the terminal for writing short things like Git commit statements. I would find myself starting to write after a break to think, and suddenly be inserting text in a completely different part of the document. For instance, in normal mode,  <code>e</code> moves the cursor to the end of the word,  <code>gg</code> moves the cursor to the beginning of the document, and  <code>i</code> switches to insert mode. So, in normal mode, if I started typing the word “beginning” anywhere in the document, I would quickly find myself on the first line having typed  <code>ng</code> with no idea where I started.
</p>

 <p>
The problem is that I stop often to think about what I’m writing, and during these pauses, would forget what mode I was in. Now, I know the mode is clearly labeled at the bottom of the screen, but that didn’t help. The other problem is that I tend to edit as I write, which, it seems, eliminates much of the advantage that Vim offers. <sup> <a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup></p>


 <p>
Then, there was my flirtation with Emacs. Emacs fits the way that I write better than Vim, and I’ll keep it around. There are several reasons that Emacs doesn’t quite fit for me, though. First, I have trouble remembering the key combinations. I thought Vim’s commands were fairly intuitive, Emacs commands never quite clicked. Second, I preferred  <a href="http://emacsformacosx.com/">Gnu Emacs</a> over  <a href="http://aquamacs.org/">Aquamacs</a> for various reasons, but  <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander">Textexpander</a> snippets wouldn’t work in Gnu Emacs. Finally, configuring both Vim and Emacs can be a long painful process for amateur geeks.
</p>

 <p>
So, I kept returning to TextMate, and kept telling myself that there really wasn’t anything wrong with TextMate, it worked fine. It was starting to seem a bit slow, and I found it difficult to ignore the arbiters of doom announcing TextMate’s demise, given the absence of version 2.0.
</p>

 <p>
Then, the heavens opened, and a beta version of TextMate 2 appeared. I downloaded it, and it just doesn’t work as well for me as TextMate 1. I’ve had  <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a> ever since it became available in the Mac App Store. It’s nice, but it just doesn’t have the ease of TextMate for LaTeX editing. Then, I heard  <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/">Brett Terpstra</a> on the   <a href="http://macpowerusers.com/">Mac Power Users</a> podcast talk about  <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a>. So, I downloaded a trial version, and showing great restraint (at least, for me) used it for three days before I bought it. It definitely appears to have been inspired by TextMate, but has many improvements over TextMate 1. It is in beta, but it seems to be solidly reliable. It is fast, edits LaTeX like TextMate, easily configurable, and beautiful.
</p>

 <p>
So, Sublime Text 2, I think I’m in love, but you need to know how fickle I am. I can give you today, we’ll just have to see what the future holds.
</p>

 <p>
UPDATE: It’s 2024 now, and I’ve been using Emacs for over a decade. I still like to try out new editors, but I’m no longer searching for a new love.

Christianity demands more than private values or partisan identity. It requires a public witness.

When we do that, we are not practicing discipleship—we are participating in civil religion. A Christianity that affirms the state’s wars is not Christianity. It is idolatry.

I found this on the  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/583028159792079">Laughing Librarian</a> Facebook page, so I don’t know have the specific source, but it’s too good not to share.
</p>

 <p>
“You sound a very educated man for a barbarian,” said Rincewind.
</p>

 <p>
“I didn’t start out a barbarian. I used to be a school teacher. But I decided to give it all up and make a living by the sword.”
</p>

 <p>
“After being a teacher all your life?”
</p>

 <p>
“It did mean a change of perspective, yes.”
</p>

 <p>
“But … well… surely … the privation, the terrible hazards, the daily risk of death…”
</p>

 <p>
Mr Saveloy brightened up. “Oh, you’ve been a teacher, have you?”

 <p>
The Christian right is dead, but the religious right is stronger than it’s ever been. Another way of putting it is that the religious right has divorced itself from historical Christian theology but still holds its partisan beliefs with religious intensity. The religious fervor is there. Christian virtues are not.

 <p>
It’s important to listen to the voices of those who have left the church. Here is one of those voices:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
I consider myself one of those who have left the American evangelical church, unable to recognize as legitimate a belief system that doesn’t worship Jesus’ example to help the poor, the sick and the hungry. A church system that doesn’t recognize Jesus’ love and empathy, but rather worships money and power for money’s and power’s sake.

  <title>Rabbi Lustig on Pope Francis</title>

 <br></br> <span class="subtitle">Apr 29, 2025 05:51</span>
</h1>
 <p>
Rabbi M. Bruce Lustig writing about a conversation with Pope Francis:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
It was quite the experience to have a private audience with the pope.
</p>

 <p>
I began to tell him: “I am Rabbi Lustig, the child of a Holocaust survivor. I grew up in Nashville, Tennessee.” Francis interrupted and said, “Bruce, may I call you that, I know who you are, you would not be here if I did not know. Now, tell me, what keeps you up at night?”
I said “hate speech,” and for the next hour, we came up with strategies to end hate speech. He listened to me, challenged my views and agreed with me that God spoke the world into being, so speech has the power to create or destroy worlds.
I left our audience with a critical lesson learned at the feet of an important teacher. There is only one voice that matters in the end: your own.
</p>

  <title>Links in Army Enterprise Email</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jan 13, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Links in Army Enterprise Email</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 13, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
This will probably be useful to only a few people, but maybe it will help someone who is frantically searching the internet for an answer.
</p>

 <p>
Roughly a year ago, the Army changed its email service to an Exchange Enterprise system. The old address, which I have had for years (decades?) forwards to the new address, which I never can seem to easily remember. It seems, though, that links in forwarded emails are stripped out for security purposes. This is not a problem if the url is visible in the message, like this:
</p>

 <p>
 <code>http://google.com</code>
</p>

 <p>
One can simply copy and paste the url into the browser. If the link is embedded into text or a graphic, though, there is nothing to copy. Any link seems to go to
</p>

 <p>
 <code>https://web-cols01.mail.mil/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx</code>
</p>

 <p>
This makes it impossible to retrieve the original linked URL.
</p>

 <p>
The problem that I had was with the Microsoft Home Use Program (HUP), which sells copies of Microsoft Office to military members at a very low price. For various reasons, I don’t like using Office, but it’s what the military uses, and I occasionally need it. Of course, to verify eligibility, the email had to be sent to a .mil address, and the link couldn’t be opened. I tried forwarding the email to a Gmail account, but the links were still broken.
</p>

 <p>
The solution was to select “Options” for the message, and forward it  <i>as an attachment</i> to Gmail. The links were still broken, but broken in a way that the original URL could be retrieved. After forwarding as an attachment, the link to Google would be
</p>

 <p>
 <code>blockedhttp://google.com</code>
</p>

 <p>
Just copy the link, paste it in, and delete the word “blocked” before pressing the enter key.
</p>

 <p>
It only took two months to figure that out. It might be better if I’d simply learn the new Enterprise address.

  <title>Prayer for the Medicated Preacher</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Prayer for the Medicated Preacher</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 13, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
To commemorate Mitch Randall’s fine, although heavily drugged, preaching on May 11, 2014:
</p>

 <p>
Loving Father,
</p>

 <p>
We give thanks for the one who, <br></br>
although (relatively) young, <br></br>
complimented “Sarah” <br></br>
even though her name is Laura;
</p>

 <p>
Who, despite years of theological education, <br></br>
urged the congregation to turn to the “Book of Moses;”
</p>

 <p>
Who, having been unable to find Sarah <br></br>
in the congregation, <br></br>
tried in vain to find her in the Exodus story.
</p>

 <p>
And so, just as your power was demonstrated by the <br></br>
babbling of those accused of imbibing on Pentecost, <br></br>
may your love and grace shine through the <br></br>
fumbling of the one who may be <br></br>
over-medicated, <br></br>
but is <br></br>
much appreciated.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

Actors of old wore masks <br></br>
to hide their true selves, <br></br>
with smiles and frowns <br></br>
frozen into place. <br></br> <br></br>
They wore expressions, <br></br>
not of who they really were, <br></br>
but of who someone thought they should be.
 <br></br>
We call our masks <br></br>
by different names: <br></br>
Facebook, <br></br>
Twitter, <br></br>
Social media; <br></br>
still used to <br></br>
project an image, <br></br>
one that even we ourselves <br></br>
can eventually come to believe.
 <br></br>
Lord Jesus, you summed up the law and <br></br>
the prophets in one simple statement: <br></br>
do to others what you would <br></br>
want them to do to you.
 <br></br>
But how can I do that <br></br>
if I cannot face who I really am?
 <br></br>
Holy Spirit, cleanse me of <br></br>
the sin of self-deception <br></br>
and open my eyes to <br></br>
who I truly am <br></br>
and what I truly want, <br></br>
that I may truly serve.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

God of Peace,

 <p>
There was a time when <br></br>

Now, we are tempted <br></br>

 <p>
Forgive us, Lord, <br></br>
for loving our own safety <br></br>
more than we love the gospel, <br></br>
and for sacrificing <br></br>
the dream of true peace <br></br>
on the altar of a <br></br>
false sense of security.

There are three statements that have become known as the “Chinese” curses, although I should point out that there is no record of any Chinese equivalents. They are three things to wish upon one’s enemies. Three things that, on the surface, seem like things that a person should surely want; but appearances, as we all know, are often deceiving.
</p>

 <p>
The first, and the mildest: “May you live in interesting times.” 
</p>

There are worse things, however, than simply living in interesting times. It is far worse to be at the center of those interesting events. Hence, the more severe curse: “May you come to the attention of powerful people.” 
</p>

 <p>
There are times, though, when even that is not enough. For those times, you need the most severe curse, something devilishly cruel and viciously twisted: “May you find what you are looking for.”
</p>

 <p>
Early this morning, Donald Trump delivered his acceptance speech after winning the 2016 United States presidential election. 
</p>

 <p>
These are interesting times indeed.

Thinking a lot about the power of language this week. Here’s my prayer for the week:
</p>

 <p>
In arrogant blindness, <br></br>
I fail to see that <br></br>
what does not offend me <br></br>
may still be offensive <br></br>
to those around me.
</p>

 <p>
Our words are keys, <br></br>
with the power to <br></br>
both lock and unlock. <br></br>
They can open doors <br></br>
to future conversations <br></br>
or close them forever. <br></br>
They can be vehicles of grace <br></br>
or weapons of hate and destruction.
</p>

 <p>
Help me choose grace.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

Holy God,
</p>

 <p>
Shall this year be like the past, <br></br>
giving up that which brings joy, <br></br>
so that my self-imposed poverty may be <br></br>
a sign of spiritual superiority?
</p>

 <p>
Instead, Lord, <br></br>
by your grace, <br></br>
may I give up <br></br>
bitterness, arrogance, <br></br>
animosity, and the <br></br>
unwarranted certainty <br></br>
that keeps me from <br></br>
loving my neighbor.
</p>

 <p>
Cover me with your ashes, <br></br>
and raise me again <br></br>
to walk anew <br></br>
in your kingdom.

  <title>A New School Year</title>

  <summary>Aug 17, 2017 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">A New School Year</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Aug 17, 2017 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
As this year’s chairperson of the Faculty Council, I am privileged to open our first employee meeting with a reading from Scripture and a prayer. This year, our academic year begins one week after the horrific display of racism and violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. That event prompted my reflection on the following text.
</p>
 <section id="outline-container-org5f3fdb9" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="org5f3fdb9">Colossians 3:1-15</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5f3fdb9">
 <blockquote>
 <p>
So if you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth, for you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ who is your life is revealed, then you also will be revealed with him in glory.
</p>

 <p>
Put to death, therefore, whatever in you is earthly: fornication, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed (which is idolatry). On account of these the wrath of God is coming on those who are disobedient. These are the ways you also once followed, when you were living that life. But now you must get rid of all such things—anger, wrath, malice, slander, and abusive language from your mouth. Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have stripped off the old self with its practices and have clothed yourselves with the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of its creator. In that renewal there is no longer Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and free; but Christ is all and in all!
</p>

 <p>
As God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience. Bear with one another and, if anyone has a complaint against another, forgive each other; just as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony. And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in the one body. And be thankful.
</p>
</blockquote>

 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf16f072">
 <p>
God of hope and Lord of life,
</p>

 <p>
Thank you for this time <br></br>
to gather together <br></br>
as friends and colleagues <br></br>
to kindle the excitement <br></br>
and hope of a new beginning.
</p>

 <p>
We give thanks and pray for our students, <br></br>
for they come here with hopes and dreams, <br></br>
and believe that this is the place where <br></br>
those hopes and dreams can become reality.
</p>

 <p>
May they never leave thinking <br></br>
that their dreams were too big, <br></br>
but instead go from here <br></br>
with a new vision of their role <br></br>
in the redemptive story <br></br>
that is far greater than <br></br>
even they had ever dared to dream.
</p>

 <p>
We pray for ourselves, <br></br>
that you would protect us from the temptations <br></br>
to answer too quickly, <br></br>
to respond with cynicism, <br></br>
and to serve the spirit that crushes hope, <br></br>
instead of our God who makes all things possible.
</p>

 <p>
We pray for our nation, <br></br>
still reeling in shock <br></br>
from what we have seen this week.
</p>

 <p>
The temptation is to despair, <br></br>
asking who are we, <br></br>
and what can we do <br></br>
when anger, wrath, and malice <br></br>
appear to win the day?
</p>

 <p>
But we are those who have been raised with Christ, <br></br>
and of all people we should have hope, <br></br>
for we have been to the cross, <br></br>
and we have seen what love can do.
</p>

 <p>
May our lives bear witness to that love <br></br>
and to the resurrection power <br></br>
that the darkness, as hard as it may try, <br></br>
can never overcome.
</p>

 <p>
In the name <br></br>
of the Father, <br></br>
and of the Son, <br></br>
and of the Holy Spirit.
</p>

 <p>
Three persons,
One God, <br></br>
forever and ever.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>Some Thoughts on Mass Shootings</title>

  <summary>Aug 06, 2019 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <h1 class="title">Some Thoughts on Mass Shootings
 <br></br> <span class="subtitle">Aug 06, 2019 00:00</span>
</h1>
 <section id="outline-container-orgbb4a89c" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="orgbb4a89c">The Second Amendment</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbb4a89c">
 <p>
Despite the Supreme Court’s 2008 Heller  <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2007/07-290">decision</a>, I have never thought that a reasonable reading of the 2nd Amendment guaranteed an individual’s unequivocal right to possess firearms. In fact, the only Supreme Court decision that focused on the 2nd Amendment,  <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1900-1940/307us174">US vs. Miller</a> in 1939, found that there is no individual right to bear arms independent of the nation’s self-defense interests. There is also reason to believe that Madison wrote the 2nd Amendment to protect the rights of southern states to have militias that they could use to put down slave revolts. <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup></p>

 <p>
I do believe, however, that every person has an inherent right to self-defense. <sup> <a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>  I take this to not be a civil right enshrined in law, but as a basic human right. Although there are weapons that are designed to be used for defensive roles, assault rifles, by definition, are not. I have no sympathy for those who argue that their guns are necessary for defense against a tyrannical government. I have seen four  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrNkl8HzPw&app=desktop">Apache helicopters</a> on an attack run at a range in Fort Hood. If you think that your AR-15 will defend you, you’ve been watching too many bad action movies. <sup> <a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup></p>
</div>
</section> <section id="outline-container-orgdb0bd27" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="orgdb0bd27">Good Guys with Guns</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdb0bd27">
 <p>
Lately, there have been demands to arm teachers to prevent school shootings. This is a variation on the idea that the only solution to gun violence is more good guys with guns. There are obvious reasons why this is untenable. We had problems with active shooters when I was in Afghanistan. The solution was not to have more people carrying guns, since everyone except me and the other two chaplains were already armed. The solution was to have a soldier standing at the ready at every meeting, doing nothing but looking for signs of hostility, prepared to shoot as soon as a weapon was drawn. That’s what the only “more guns” solution looks like – an armed guard standing with weapon drawn in every classroom, in every corridor of the mall, covering every line of sight in every public venue, etc. <sup> <a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup>  That’s not a country where I want to live.
</p>
</div>
</section> <section id="outline-container-orgfae2450" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="orgfae2450">Possible Solutions</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfae2450">
 <p>
Mass shootings are a complex problem, but not irreducibly complex. We shouldn’t pretend that our only options are an impossible perfect solution and doing nothing. So, what should be done? There are some means that, I believe, would help reduce the level of gun violence.
</p>

 <ol class="org-ol"> <li>Treating sources of terrorism consistently would be a good first step. White nationalism has always been an ideology associated with terrorism, from the lynchings of Reconstruction to the mass shooting in El Paso. As a terrorist ideology, white nationalist demands for racial purity are no different than demands for religious purity from other movements that we rightly label as terrorists.</li>
 <li>Ban assault weapons — that has already been shown to be effective.</li>
 <li>Ban high capacity magazines. Otherwise, thirty people are dead before the “good guy with a gun” has an opportunity to respond.</li>
</ol> <p>
May God forgive me, if I ever demand my rights at the possible expense of another human being’s life.

Conservatives had no problem with gun control when the Black Panthers were taking up arms to press for equal civil rights. As Governor of California, Ronald Reagan signed an act in 1967 banning the carrying by members of the public of loaded firearms in cities. He  <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=5PRABAAAQBAJ&pg=PT73&lpg=PT73&dq=%E2%80%9Cwould+work+no+hardship+on+the+honest+citizen.%E2%80%9D+reagan&source=bl&ots=cq6Kl3wRXB&sig=AaCua1410lGebtc18y0CD85uRok&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjvivOHxNfWAhUn4IMKHYaDAuYQ6AEINzAD#v=onepage&q=%E2%80%9Cwould%20work%20no%20hardship%20on%20the%20honest%20citizen.%E2%80%9D%20reagan&f=false">said</a> there is “no reason why on the street today a citizen should be carrying loaded weapons.” It’s also curious how reticent the NRA is to come to the defense of registered African-American gun owners.

Specifying this right will, by no means, be simple. I do not believe that people have the right to do  <i>anything</i> that will result in saving their lives. I also do not believe that the right to self-defense is automatically a right to kill, if there are other effective means available. There are also tricky questions about prisoners on death row, etc. This is also a right that implies certain duties, like the duty to ensure, as much as possible, that no innocent people are harmed. This means that gun-owners have a duty to acquire and maintain a high level of skill. This could mean that the public has a right to demand that those who wish to carry firearms in public be tested and certified.

I’ve also recently heard that when criminals get semi-automatic weapons, then citizens need full-auto. In my infantry days, the only situation in which fully automatic fire was used was to spray a room with bullets before entering. So, saying this is the same as saying “When criminals get semi-auto, then citizens kill indiscriminately.”

That doesn’t mean that a member of the public with a gun will not occasionally act to prevent, or minimize, some tragedy. That will have to be weighed against members of the public misidentifying a target or harm done by negligent discharges, a particular problem that we had in Iraq.

I’m testing some a couple of new functions. One is to add a tag to a post by selecting from a list of tags used on the site, like  <a href="2023-02-04-venn-diagrams-in-latex!.html">this</a>. Another is for inserting links to other pages on the site using  <code>org-insert-link</code>. The last updates the last modified date when a post is published.

Everything seems to be working fine.

  <title>Millennium Development Goals</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>May 18, 2008 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Millennium Development Goals</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">May 18, 2008 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Yesterday, Mitch Randall, pastor of  <a href="http://www.northhavenchurch.net/"> NorthHaven Church</a> in Norman, preached on Christianity and Justice. In his message, he discussed the Millennium Development Goals, seven goals that have been adopted by the world’s countries, including the United States. It is legitimate for the church to ask what we can do to help our own nation achieve its stated goals.
</p>

 <p>
The eight goals are outlined on the  <a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/index.html"> United Nations Website</a>:
</p>

 <ol class="org-ol"> <li>Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger <br></br></li>
 <li>Achieve universal primary education <br></br></li>
 <li>Promote gender equality and empower women <br></br></li>
 <li>Reduce child mortality <br></br></li>
 <li>Improve maternal health <br></br></li>
 <li>Combat HIV/AIDS, marlaria and other diseases <br></br></li>
 <li>Ensure environmental sustainability <br></br></li>
 <li>Develop a global partnership for development</li>
</ol> <p>
You can read a progress report  <a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/docs/UNSD_MDG_Report_2007e.pdf">here</a>. Each region of the world shows progress in almost every category, but there is still much work to do. These goals should be the goals of the church, for they certainly seem consistent with Jesus’ stated mission in Luke 4:18-19: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.”
</p>

 <p>
May his mission be our own.

  <title>International Aid and Religious Freedom</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>May 19, 2008 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">International Aid and Religious Freedom</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">May 19, 2008 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
I am a Baptist who is committed to religious freedom, and I think that the separation of church and state is critical for maintaining religious freedom. I also believe in the value of the classical liberal tradition, in which everyone should have the freedom to choose their own values and act to achieve what they think is good, provided that it does not interfere with another’s ability to do the same. So, I am generally suspicious of legislation that interferes with the liberties of other people when my religious beliefs provide the sole reason for favoring the proposed law.
</p>

 <p>
I am, however, advocating that the country increase the amount of money that we spend on international aid, specifically aid that is designed to reduce poverty. Yesterday, I claimed that this is consistent with the teachings of Jesus, but even aside from religious motivations, such aid is in our national interest. One could liken it to the rebuilding of Europe and Japan following World War II. Post-war reconstruction was not only the morally right thing to do, it also had immense national security benefits.
</p>

 <p>
This same point was made by National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley in an  <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/02/20080204-5.html">address</a> to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in February. Let’s not simply rest on our past achievements, though.

We are leaving tomorrow for a week in Costa Rica. We’re all looking forward to a wonderful trip. Costa Rica should be quite a bit different than anywhere I’ve been recently. I’ll post some pictures when we get back.

  <title>Costa Rica</title>

  <summary>Jun 01, 2008 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Costa Rica</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jun 01, 2008 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
We had a wonderful week in Costa Rica. It is a beautiful country filled with charming people. We had a tour of the rain forest canopy and two bus trips through the countryside. If you ever plan a trip to Costa Rica, consider avoiding the rainy season. It did rain every day while we were there, but cleared up beautifully, of course, on the day that we left.
</p>

 <p>
While we were on the bus traveling to the rain forest, our guide, Oliver, gave us a lesson on the history, geography, and culture of the country. Two things that he was particularly proud of were that the country has no army and that they have more teachers than police. Speaking of human rights in Costa Rica and the lack of class conflict, he said “We were lucky to be a poor country.” I found his comment to be particularly striking. Why does this country develop into a stable and prosperous one that is free from both internal and external conflict? Oliver implies that it is because they didn’t have anything that the developed world really wanted.
</p>

 <p>
Things could be changing, both for us and the rest of the world, though. In this interesting piece in today’s  <i>New York Times</i>,  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/02/opinion/l02cohen.html?th&amp;emc=th">Roger Cohen</a> points out that two-thirds of last year’s economic growth was in the developing world. This could indeed be a reversal of fortune.

The  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/02/AR2008060202698.html?wpisrc=newsletter%22%20title=%22Climate%20Findings%20Were%20Distorted,%20Probe%20Finds%20-%20washingtonpost.com"> <i>Washington Post</i></a> reports something today that is unfortunate but unsurprising. NASA’s inspector general has determined that political appointees have controlled and distorted information about research on climate change conducted by NASA scientists. This is why it is so difficult for the layperson like myself to make informed decisions about the severity of the problem and the best response to the problem. Such decisions should be made on the basis of the best science, but what we know about the science has been distorted by those who have already decided what is to be done.

  <title>World Food Summit</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jun 08, 2008 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">World Food Summit</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jun 08, 2008 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
The summit on soaring food prices ended last week. For years, I have read that there is plenty of food available to feed everyone on the planet, but the problem was distributing that food. We know from recent events in Myanmar that uncooperative regimes can make aid distribution impossible. Now, though, it seems that there is a genuine food shortage, not simply a problem of distribution. What has changed?
</p>

 <p>
My guess is that we will all try to find the one cause of the crisis, and each group will propose a different cause depending on their political leanings. We should keep in mind that complex situations generally have complex causes, and oversimplification often exacerbates the problem. Here are a few things that need to be considered.
</p>

 <p>
First, serious research needs to be done on the effects of climate change on agriculture and fisheries. Some of the best evidence that climate change is occurring is the change in elevations and temperate zones in which plant species are growing. One of our guides in Costa Rica even mentioned that crops are growing in higher elevations now, which means that they are not growing in some of the lower elevations.
</p>

 <p>
Second, we need to take a serious look at where our aid dollars are going. On June 3, <a title=“The world only needs 30 billion dollars a year to eradicate the scourge of hunger”
</p>

 <p>
Jacques Diouf, Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, appealed to the developed world for 30 billion dollars a year for agriculture aid. Incidentally, he estimated that 100 billion dollars of food is wasted every year in a single country, although he failed to mention which country it was. Aid for agriculture fell from 8 billion dollars in 1984 to 3.4 billion in 2004.
</p>

 <p>
There are other things that are likely to be playing a role in the increased food shortage such as the ever-increasing percentage of agricultural output that is used for biofuels and decreasing agricultural efficiency in many developing countries. One mistake we cannot afford to make is to fail to consider how this problem is related to other problems that the world faces, as this  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/09/opinion/09mon1.html?th&amp;emc=th">NY Times editorial</a> points out. Agriculture and climate are obviously related, but so are food costs and energy costs, as are the dollars available for agricultural aid and dollars spent to combat terrorism. On the other hand, it also seems likely that hungry people that have no hope are more likely to be potential recruits for terrorist organizations. These problems are complex enough now, and they are not likely to get easier to solve with time. It’s time to get started.

Both presidential candidates seem to be stressing the importance of adopting policies that are good for the middle class. I have to admit that such talk resonates with me, probably because I am a member of the middle class. Today, though, I saw a title of a  <a href="http://www.sojo.net/blog/godspolitics/?p=2741">blog post</a> by Adam Taylor that is making me rethink my assumptions about the priority of the middle class.
</p>

 <p>
It was titled “Just as You Did for the Middle Class, You Also Did for Me.”
</p>

 <p>
Ouch…

  <title>Academic Reference Software</title>

  <summary>Oct 24, 2008 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Academic Reference Software</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Oct 24, 2008 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
If you have writing projects that require footnotes, endnotes, bibliographies, or other kinds of references, you should consider getting some kind of reference manager software. Short papers with a few references are easy enough to manage with a word processor alone, but significant projects can easily be overwhelming. There is enough pain in academic writing that one does not need the extra suffering caused by having to make sure that every work cited is included in the bibliography, that the entries are all in alphabetical order, and that the notes and bibliography entries are all in the right format. A reference manager can do all of this automatically. Unfortunately, they’re generally very expensive.
</p>

 <p>
The good news is that  <a href="http://www.thirdstreetsoftware.com/site/introduction.html%22%20title=%22The%20Academic%20Reference%20Manager%20for%20Mac%20OS%20X">Third Street Software</a> just released an undergraduate edition of its reference manager software, Sente. The individual library size is limited to 250 entries, but that should be sufficient for most student writing. It’s also Mac OS X only, but now you have one more way to convince you parents that you really need that new Mac notebook: “I know it seems more expensive now, but I promise that it will save you money in the long run….” Good luck, let me know if it works.

I passed a church this morning that had this statement on the sign: “Indifference Not Hate.” I’m curious what is meant by this, is it supposed to be a statement of reassurance to the community? “It’s not that we hate you, we really just don’t care….” Would you rather be hated or simply ignored? At least hate is an acknowledgment of the existence and importance of the other person.

In Philosophy of Mind today, I claimed that the ability to respond to the environment meant that an organism was at least minimally conscious. Michael Novotny then asked if that entailed that certain mechanisms were conscious. For example, a trap door opens when a certain weight is place on it. It seems to be responding to the environment, so does that mean that it is conscious? If not, then what’s wrong with my claim about the condition for minimal consciousness?

It’s interesting that the prominent atheist  <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/3255972/Harry-Potter-fails-to-cast-spell-over-Professor-Richard-Dawkins.html">Richard Dawkins</a> is now claiming that reading J.K. Rowling’s  <i>Harry Potter</i> books is dangerous for children.
</p>

 <p>
I never thought I would see Richard Dawkins taking the same position as conservative Christians.

  <title>Moral Relativism</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Nov 01, 2008 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Moral Relativism</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Nov 01, 2008 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
In Ethics, Friday, I sketched out an argument against moral relativism that appeals to the standard argument  <i>for</i> moral relativism. The following is a typical argument for moral relativism:
</p>


 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>There is widespread disagreement about ethical claims.</li>
 <li>There is no rational way to settle this disagreement.</li>
 <li>If there is no rational way to settle a disagreement concerning a claim, then we should deny that such claims are objectively true.</li>
 <li>Therefore, ethical claims are not objectively true.</li>
</ul> <p>
So, for any moral claim, that claim then there is at least one conceptual scheme in which that claim is true and at least one in which that claim is false. If this argument for moral relativism is convincing, then one should be equally convinced of this argument against moral relativism:
</p>


 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>There is widespread disagreement about moral relativism.</li>
 <li>There is no rational way to settle this disagreement.</li>
 <li>If there is no rational way to settle a disagreement concerning a claim, then we should deny that such claims are objectively true.</li>
 <li>Therefore, moral relativism is not objectively true.</li>
</ul> <p>
Why should a claim that something is not objectively true bother someone who rejects objective truth?
</p>

 <p>
Moral relativists are committed to the claim that moral truths are dependent on conceptual schemes, but if that claim is itself dependent on one’s conceptual scheme, then there is a conceptual scheme in which moral relativism is false. So, there is at least one conceptual scheme in which it is true that moral claims are true in every conceptual scheme. The only way that can be true is if moral truths are in fact true in every conceptual scheme. So, moral relativism is false.

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Reconciliation and Hope</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Nov 07, 2008 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
The year that I was born, 1963, was marked by these significant events:
</p>


 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>In April, Martin Luther King was arrested and jailed in Birmingham.</li>
 <li>In May, “Bull” Connor, the Commissioner of Public Safety in Birmingham used police dogs and fire hoses on a demonstration in Birmingham.</li>
 <li>In June, Medgar Evers, the NAACP Field Secretary for Mississippi, was murdered outside his home.</li>
 <li>In August, Martin Luther King delivered his famous “I Have a Dream” speech at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.</li>
 <li>In September, four young girls were killed in the bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham.</li>
</ul> <p>
Tuesday, an African-American man was elected President of the United States.
</p>

 <p>
The country has certainly come far. European countries are generally viewed as far more progressive than the United States, but, as far as I can tell, no European country is even remotely close to being able to select a member of a minority racial group as head of government.
</p>

 <p>
That said, we still have a long ways to go before we can claim to have achieved racial reconciliation. On November 5, David Garland, President of Baylor University, issued a  <a href="http://www.baylor.edu/lariat/news.php?action=story&amp;story=54314">statement</a> concerning recent incidents of racial conflict on Baylor’s campus. We cannot hope to achieve reconciliation in this country if we are not even able to achieve it in the Church. It is time for the Church to not only ask forgiveness for our past sins regarding slavery, but to recognize that failing to take action to create a better future is itself a sin.
</p>

 <p>
If nothing else, this week’s election is a sign of hope.

  <title>The Monty Hall Problem</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">The Monty Hall Problem</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Nov 18, 2008 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
One of the assignments in Critical Thinking was to figure the probability of winning the prize in the traditional three-door Monty Hall problem. Remember that there are three doors for you, the contestant, to choose from, but only one has the prize. The host knows what door the prize is behind, and opens another door to show you that there is nothing there. He will open neither the one you pick nor the one that has the prize. Let’s say that you pick Door 1, and Monty opens Door 2. What’s the probability that the prize is behind Door 3? From class, you know the answer is 2/3.
</p>

 <p>
What’s important is that the host knows where the prize is. If he doesn’t know, then the probability is 1/2. You can calculate this using Bayes’ Theorem. Try it out!
</p>

 <p>
By the way, if you can remember “1/2” then you should be able to get some extra-credit points on tomorrow’s exam. Even more points if you can do the calculation….

Two stories in today’s news caught my attention. First, Britain’s / <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/the-ipod-its-bound-to-fail-and-the-other-predictions-the-experts-would-rather-forget-1061286.html">The Independent </a>/reports on history’s most famous failed technology predictions. These include a claim from 1977 that no one will need a computer in their home.
</p>

 <p>
The second story, in the  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/11/AR2008121104080_pf.html">Washington Post</a>, is a harrowing account of an assault conducted by U. S. Special Forces soldiers and Afghan commandos on an insurgent stronghold in Afghanistan. Ten of those soldiers will receive the Silver Star today.

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Expectations and Grades</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Feb 19, 2009 00:00</p>

There’s an interesting piece in the  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/18/education/18college.html?_r=2&amp;ref=todayspaper">New York Times</a> today about student expectations and grade inflation. Apparently, there are students (at institutions other than Oklahoma Baptist, I’m sure) that believe that doing the minimal work that is required of everyone in the course should be sufficient to earn a B for the course. Either we have lowered the level of work that we are willing to consider average, or it really is true that in today’s society someone who manages to complete the minimum requirements really is above average. Either disjunct strikes me as disturbing. If you are in Critical Thinking, keep this story in mind. It is relevant to some of the topics that we will be discussing later.

Back to the blog after a very long break. Geographers from Kansas State University have mapped out the  <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2009/05/12/maps-of-the-seven-deadly-sins/">distribution of the seven deadly sins</a> (lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy and pride) across the United States. Interestingly, Oklahoma appears to be in good shape except for wrath.

Dale Tuggy has a new  <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/trinity/">article</a> in The  <i>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</i> on the Trinity. In my opinion,  <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/"> <i>The Stanford Encyclopedia</i></a> is the best reference work in philosophy, not simply the best online reference work in philosophy. I’ve been slowly working on a paper on the Trinity, so I’m grateful to have a nice summary of recent work on the subject.

</p>

 <p>
From the  <i>NY Times</i>: “A recent 93-page report on online education, conducted by SRI International for the Department of Education, has a starchy academic title, but a most intriguing conclusion: ‘On average, students in online learning conditions performed better than those receiving face-to-face instruction.’”
</p>

 <p>
Surprising.

 <i>Triumph of the Will</i>, directed by Leni Riefenstahl, is the film that I couldn’t remember in Aesthetics this morning. Roger Ebert, in his 1994  <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19940624/REVIEWS/406240302/1023">review</a> of a documentary about Riefenstahl asks exactly the right question:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
“These are by general consent two of the best documentaries ever made. But because they reflect the ideology of a monstrous movement, they pose a classic question of the contest between art and morality: Is there such a thing as pure art, or does all art make a political statement?”
</p>
</blockquote>

Yesterday, I received an anonymous package by campus mail that contained this. I assume it was sent by a student in my Aesthetics class. It’s a good example of an adequacy condition for an aesthetic theory — any theory that claims that this is good art must be rejected.
</p>

 <p>
What should I do to get even? Maybe we’ll have to reinstate those daily presentations.

Another package arrived in the mail today, wrapped in tissue paper with my address scrawled in permanent marker. Is it art? Let’s consider the theories that are in contention.
</p>

 <p>
Art as mimesis - No human being has eyes like that, so it’s a bad imitation.
</p>

 <p>
Art as expression - Surely the artist couldn’t have been experiencing the same emotion that I’m experiencing as I look on these. I wouldn’t wish that on any human being.
</p>

 <p>
Formalism - What do you really think Clive Bell would say about this?
</p>

 <p>
Institutional theory - Purporting to confer the status of art in this case is conclusive proof that you never had the right to confer such status at all.
</p>

 <p>
I’m standing by my earlier claim: it’s still not art.
</p>

 <p>
I hope that sale at the dollar store ends soon.

Interesting  <a href="http://www.thebigdaddyweave.com/2009/10/burning-bibles-baptist-style.html">post</a> today on the big daddy weave blog about a church that will burn translations other than the King James for Halloween. They’ll also be burning an eclectic collection of music and books. The list of authors considered heretical is amazingly broad.

  <title>Car Accidents and Conditional Probabilities</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Oct 21, 2009 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Car Accidents and Conditional Probabilities</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Oct 21, 2009 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
A problem we looked at in Critical Thinking today asked why most car accidents occur close to home. The answer is that most of our driving is close to home. The problem then asked us to explain that in terms of conditional probabilities. I don’t think that I explained it very well, so let me take another shot at it.
</p>

 <p>
Remember the definition of conditional probability: \(\Pr ( A \mid B) = \frac{ \Pr (A \& B)}{\Pr (B)} \)
</p>

 <p>
Let’s assume that 90% of driving is close to home and 10% is not. Let’s also assume that the probability of having a car accident is 0.1 (that’s high, but it will keep the math easy). Then, the probability of being near home given that you had an accident is equal to the probability of the conjunction of being near home and having an accident divided by the probability of having an accident, or \(\Pr(H \mid A) = \frac{\Pr(H \& A)}{\Pr(A)}\).
</p>

 <p>
On the assumptions I made above concerning the relative frequencies of trips and accidents, out of 110 total trips, 11 are away from home and 99 are near home. Out of those 11 trips away from home, 1 is an accident. Out of the 99 near home, 10 are accidents. So, \(\Pr(H \mid A) = \frac{.1}{.11} = .90\), but \(\Pr(\neg H \mid A) = \frac{.01}{.11} = .09\).
</p>

 <p>
Another way to look at it is to use Bayes’ Theorem, but we’ll save that for another time.
</p>

From the “ <a href="http://tar.weatherson.org/">Thoughts, Arguments, and Rants</a>” blog, here is a link to a band called “ <a href="http://people.umass.edu/phil511/monads/">The Monads</a>” and it’s reincarnation, “The 21st Century Monads.” No educated person could resist songs with titles like “The Skeptic Song” and “The Missing Shade of Blues.” There’s even a song expressing the emotional depths of the academic life: “My Paper Was Rejected Again.”

My darling wife, Sheri, is watching the PBS version of Jane Austen’s  <i>Northanger Abbey</i> this evening. I have a set of wireless headphones that I call the “Jane Austen Specials” to wear at such times. Unfortunately, I didn’t make sure that they were charged this afternoon. A great mistake on my part.

  <title>Tradition and Bad Tradition</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Feb 15, 2010 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Tradition and Bad Tradition</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Feb 15, 2010 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Recently, I posted a quote on the  <a href="http://rlridenour.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> page from Jaroslav Pelikan: “The only alternative to tradition is bad tradition.” At the time, I realized it needed some explanation, but posted it anyway. Some comments show that the quote is meaningless without some context.
</p>

 <p>
John Mouracade pointed out that it looks like a false dilemma. A false dilemma is a fallacy committed when one asserts that at least one of two different alternatives must be true, but ignores other alternatives that might also be true. Now, if Pelikan meant to say that the only alternative to  <i>good</i> tradition is bad tradition, then it’s clearly a false dilemma. Surely, some tradition is neither good nor bad. Pelikan didn’t say that, though. He said that the only alternative to tradition (unqualified) is  <i>bad tradition</i>.
</p>

 <p>
Is that claim a false dilemma? On the surface it looks like it is. The claim is that one is either bound by tradition or by bad tradition. What about breaking from tradition completely? Surely that’s an option. Pelikan has asserted two alternatives and ignored a third.
</p>

 <p>
Of course, it were a simple logical fallacy, the claim wouldn’t be very interesting (and Pelikan probably wouldn’t have deserved that prestigious chair at Yale!). Notice that Pelikan has not asserted that one of two different alternatives must be true. Since every instance of bad tradition is an instance of tradition, they are not two different things. Instead, he has asserted simply that there is no escaping tradition. That may be false, but it’s not a false dilemma. If it were a false dilemma, then every false assertion commits the fallacy of a false dilemma. To say that either all roses are red or all roses are red is simply to say that all roses are red.
</p>

 <p>
In the interview that I quote from (an episode of Public Radio’s  <a href="http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/pelikan//"> <i>Speaking of Faith</i></a>), Pelikan is discussing the relationship of belief and church tradition. His claim is directed toward those who deny that tradition should play any role in our belief. A church could decide that tradition should play no role in the context of belief, or “We don’t let tradition determine what we believe, we decide ourselves.” Does this constitute an escape from tradition? In a sense, yes, but it really just constitutes the establishment of a new tradition. “It is our tradition not to pay any attention to past traditions….”
</p>

 <p>
It is best to intentionally critically examine one’s tradition and keep the best parts of that tradition. There are two other likely alternatives, one is a break with past tradition that simply establishes a new tradition. The other is one that continues to hold on to the less desirable components of past tradition. Neither are likely to result in the best outcome. The latter keeps the things that we should be breaking from, while the former breaks from things that we should be retaining. So, indeed, the only alternative to tradition is bad tradition.
</p>

 <p>
For philosophers, that means we shouldn’t stop teaching Plato and Aristotle. For Baptists, it means that we ignore the study of Baptist history at our peril. I guess the moral of the story is this: if you are a religion major and one of my advisees, don’t ask to be excused from that Baptist History requirement. Keep in mind, though, there’s no Baptist History requirement for a philosophy major.

  <title>The Luxury of Cheap Melancholy</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Feb 18, 2010 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">The Luxury of Cheap Melancholy</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Feb 18, 2010 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Every February, Oklahoma Baptist University celebrates Founders’ Day with a special chapel service. This year’s service was particularly special, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the school’s founding. The service included a reenactment of W.P. Blake and G. Lee Phelps kneeling in prayer on the site in Shawnee, Oklahoma that was to become Oklahoma Baptist University.
</p>

 <p>
To be honest, I can now remember only a single sentence from either prayer, but it is a sentence that I don’t think I will ever forget:  <i>“Deliver us from the luxury of cheap melancholy.”</i>
</p>

 <p>
These words may be more relevant now than they were at the time of the founding of OBU. We find ourselves struggling to recover from a recession, embroiled in two wars, worried about the future of the environment, and burdened by spiraling health care costs. Melancholy, or depression, seems to be an unavoidable response. As Phelps said, though, it is both cheap and luxurious; cheap because it costs us nothing, and luxurious because it prevents us from doing what is truly costly. Giving in to the luxury of cheap melancholy is an acceptance of the status quo, an admission that we will simply do nothing.
</p>

 <p>
The alternative is to remember who we are and what God has called us to be, people of hope and grace. I was reminded of this as I witnessed a baptism at church on Sunday. In our church, before the baptismal candidate leaves the water, she places a finger in a bowl of salt and then touches the salt to her tongue. She then receives a candle, which she carries out of the baptistry. We who are witnesses are reminded that we too are called to be salt and light, to reject the luxury of cheap melancholy, and go into the world believing that we can, by the grace of God, make things better.
</p>

 <p>
May it be so.
</p>

It appears that Mill was right — it is better to be a dissatisfied Socrates than a satisfied pig.

I’m back at the Chaplains’ School for the first time in seven years. One of my classmates for this course asked me today if I was a runner. He said that I looked like someone who passed him on a 5-K in Baghdad. We were stationed on the same base at the same time, so I guess it was me. In honor of those memories, I posted a photo of the 378th Baghdad Army Ten-Miler group. This was before the race, I’m not looking so good in the after-race picture.

</header> <p>
From the leader of a Mosque in Columbia, speaking about partnering with other groups to provide social services to people in an area of the city suffering from high poverty and crime rates:
</p>


 <blockquote>
 <p>
We’ve been able to work with the Methodists and the Episcopalians. The Baptists…, well, we have to be patient with the Baptists.

 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Apr 18, 2010 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
From a briefing given by an Army Chaplain about the new Inter-service Chaplain Center that is shared by the Army, Navy, and Air Force:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
“We didn’t foresee the challenges that we would have with a building shared by the three services. Each service has its own customs, traditions, and even language. For example, we had to order three different signs for the restrooms - one that said ‘Latrine’ for the Army, ‘Head’ for the Navy, and ‘Powder Room’ for the Air Force.”
</p>

  <title>Visit to Ft. Moultrie</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Apr 18, 2010 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Visit to Ft. Moultrie</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Apr 18, 2010 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Yesterday, my class at the chaplain school participated in a staff ride to Charleston. “Staff ride” sounds more impressive than “field trip” but they mean the same thing. The highlight of the visit was a trip to Ft. Moultrie on Sullivan’s Island. The defense of the fort in 1776 was the first major victory over the British in the Revolutionary War. Standing on the high ground at Ft. Moultrie, you can look straight across the harbor and see Ft. Sumter. The attack on Ft. Sumter on April 12, 1861 marks the beginning of armed conflict in the American Civil War. Then, if you scan to the left, you can see Morris Island, which is the site of Ft. Wagner. On July 18, 1863, the 54th Massachusetts assaulted Ft. Wagner, an event portrayed in the movie  <i>Glory</i>. There, Sergeant William H. Carney secured the United States flag as the color-bearer fell, the first action for which an African-American would be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.
</p>

 <p>
It’s a moving experience to see a century of history and heroism from one spot on the South Carolina coast.

We went to the Confidence Course at Ft. Sill on Saturday. I came back with a black eye, multiple bruises, and a sprained knee. I also had a soldier come to chapel on Sunday who had never attended before. What’s a few bruises for the sake of the Gospel?

There is, in a word, nothing comfortable about the Bible – until we manage to get so used to it that we make it comfortable for ourselves. But then we are perhaps too used to it and too at home in it. Let us not be too sure we know the Bible … just because we have learned not to have problems with it. Have we perhaps learned … not to really pay attention to it? Have we ceased to question the book and be questioned by it?

  <title>A Mosque in NYC</title>

  <summary>Aug 16, 2010 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">A Mosque in NYC</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Aug 16, 2010 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
I’ve been following the debate over the proposed Mosque near the site of the World Trade Center in New York City. Baptists have historically been champions of religious liberty, and denying Muslims the right to build a house of worship is contrary to historic Baptist principles.
</p>

 <p>
The question to ask is this - would you be happy with a Christian Church at the same location? If so, then do not deny Muslim-Americans the same rights that you are willing to give Christian-Americans.
</p>

 <p>
It is relevant to consider the setting for the proposed Mosque. This is not a Mosque on the grounds of a tranquil place for reflection dedicated to the memory of those who perished. Instead, this is a Mosque in a neighborhood where people live, work, and deserve to have places to worship as their conscience demands. For pictures of the neighborhood, see this post from  <a href="file://daryllang.com/blog/4421">Daryl Lang</a>.

 <a href="http://www.ethicsdaily.com">EthicsDaily.com</a> has an interesting story about a recent Pew Forum survey on religious knowledge in the United States. Jews, Mormons, and atheists/agnostics appear to know more about world religions than American Christians.
</p>

 <p>
For those who would like to test their own knowledge, the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life has provided a  <a href="http://features.pewforum.org/quiz/us-religious-knowledge/">short version of the survey</a> that you can take online.

  <title>The Christian Literary Underground</title>

 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Oct 22, 2010 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
The November issue of  <a href="http://www.sojo.net/index.cfm?action=magazine.article&amp;issue=soj1011&amp;article=the-borderlands-of-publishing"> <i>Sojourners</i> Magazine</a> has an interesting article by Julie Polter about the “Christian literary underground.” There is also a  <a href="http://blog.sojo.net/2010/10/21/7-essential-tips-for-fitting-in-with-the-christian-literary-underground-scene-near-you/">slightly tongue-in-cheek post</a> on their website by Betsy Shirley titled “7 Essential Tips for Fitting in With the Christian Literary Underground Scene Near You!” I’m pleased to see that the first essential tip is this:
</p>


 <blockquote>
 <p>
Be seen reading the grittier classics of Christian literature. Though  <i>Blue Like Jazz</i> is an almost irresistible first choice, try for something more subtle, like Flannery O’Connor, J.D. Salinger, or T.S. Eliot. And when all else fails,  <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> is a sure-bet.
</p>
</blockquote>


 <p>
I’m glad to see that we’ve gone for the “sure-bet” in the Existentialism course this semester.

Our task is simply to recognize that.’

The ethical and moral issues that face people in the U.S. have a great deal to do with how we see the world, whether we see it as interconnected or not, our responsibility for our neighbors nearby and far away, how we’re going to use the resources and the gifts we have to the benefit of somebody beyond our own selves

  <title>If you could have only one thing for Christmas</title>

If you could have only one thing for Christmas
</p>

 <p>
In today’s  <a href="http://wapo.st/dHHR2P">Washington Post</a>, Petula Dvorak’s column includes a story about a 6-year-old who was told by her mother to scale back her Christmas list. So, she wrote a letter to “Dear Sata” asking for just one thing, a remote control that controlled the world.
</p>

 <p>
When her mother pointed out that the salutation was missing an “N”, she simply added it to the end of the name. So, it read, “Dear Satan,…” Fitting, somehow.
</p>

Bob Feller, who pitched for the Cleveland Indians from 1936 to 1956,  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/16/sports/baseball/16feller.html?scp=1&amp;sq=%22bob%20feller%22&amp;st=cse">died Wednesday</a> in Cleveland. In Alan Schwarz’s 2006 book,  <i>Once Upon a Game: Baseball’s Greatest Memories</i>, he spoke of his decision to leave professional baseball after the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor and enlist in the United States Navy.
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
A lot of folks say that had I not missed those almost four seasons to World War II — during what was probably my physical prime — I might have had 370 or even 400 wins. But I have no regrets. None at all. I did what any American could and should do: serve his country in its time of need. The world’s time of need.
</p>

 <p>
I knew then, and I know today, that winning World War II was the most important thing to happen to this country in the last 100 years. I’m just glad I was a part of it.

Mary represents the ’rebel consciousness’ that is essential to Jesus’ gospel. Wherever the gospel is preached, we must remember that its good news will make you crazy.

This is for all my students who send me emails at 3:00 in the morning.
</p>


 <p>
From Tony Schwarz’s post titled “Sleep is More Important than Food” at the  <a href="http://bit.ly/hC4REa">Harvard Business Review</a>:
</p>


 <blockquote>
 <p>

</p>


 <p>
…In reality, the research suggests that even small amounts of sleep deprivation take a significant toll on our health, our mood, our cognitive capacity and our productivity.
</p>


 <p>
Many of the effects we suffer are invisible. Insufficient sleep, for example, deeply impairs our ability to consolidate and stabilize learning that occurs during the waking day. In other words, it wreaks havoc on our memory.
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
Sleep deprivation doesn’t appear to be the best strategy to achieve a fulfilling educational experience. I have some grading to do, but I think I’ll take a nap instead.

  <title>Calculating the End — Again and Again</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Calculating the End — Again and Again</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">May 13, 2011 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Apparently, there are many discussing what to expect on May 21. Of course, it’s not the first time that the end of the world has been predicted. Bill Leonard, professor of church history at Wake Forest, recently posted an article at  <a href="http://www.abpnews.com/content/view/6387/9/">Associated Baptist Press</a>  reviewing past mistaken predictions. Note the final two paragraphs:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
For now, let’s keep last things last. The end will come, for individuals and ultimately for the entire enterprise, but perhaps the answers lie, not in escapist theories, but with dying whales, vanishing forests, polluted water and rising ozone, “the fire next time.” We recalculate yet another “Great Disappointment,” but refuse to listen to what the world and its non-human inhabitants are telling us. We hope for “peace and security,” plotting our escape as the planet cries in pain, edging toward its own end.
</p>

 <p>
So if there is an ounce of Jesus in any of us, let’s opt out of the Rapture and stay right here to the bitter end, because there is still justice to be done and too much good to be accomplished to forsake this world, even in Jesus’ name. For Jesus’ sake let’s stay behind, loving God with all our hearts, and if we can muster it, loving our neighbors as ourselves.  What Rapture!
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
Well said.

  <title>Reinstalling Apps from the App Store</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Nov 23, 2011 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Reinstalling Apps from the App Store</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Nov 23, 2011 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
I was having some trouble with BBEdit on one of my machines, so I decided to delete and reinstall the application. That’s not very difficult in ordinary circumstances, but since I bought from the App Store, it should have been even easier. There should be no need to enter any license information, just a click and install.
</p>

 <p>
First, I deleted the app. I deleted BBEdit from the applications folder. Somehow, it was still in Launchpad. So, I deleted it from Launchpad. Surely that would be enough.
</p>

 <p>
Unfortunately, after I deleted the application, the App Store still thought that it was installed and wouldn’t let me download another copy. With the aid of a great little application called  <a href="http://apps.tempel.org/FindAnyFile/">Find Any File</a>, I removed every trace of BBEdit from the machine, including all preference files and application support files.
</p>

 <p>
The App Store was still convinced that it was installed.
</p>

 <p>
Then, I began searching the internet, which revealed some frustrated App Store customers, who were mostly frustrated with their Xcode experience. The search didn’t help.
</p>

 <p>
For some reason, I decided to go back to Launchpad and saw the BBEdit icon there. I clicked it and BBEdit started right up, though without my usual color scheme since I had deleted the application support folder. So, where was the file? On a whim, I disconnected my backup drive, opened the App Store, and BBEdit was finally gone with the option to install. I Pressed the install button, and BBEdit was automatically installed.
</p>

 <p>
Lesson: Launchpad sees apps on external drives, so disconnect any external drives to install a deleted app to your main drive. Then, reinstalling  <i>should</i> be the quick and easy process that it’s supposed to be.

Thanksgiving should be an opportunity for reflection, not for the gluttony and sloth that has become the norm. One of my favorite Thanksgiving traditions to share the latest world hunger statistics with my Introduction to Philosophy class. I then urge the students to spend the break reading Ron Sider’s book,  <i>Rich Christians in an Age of Hunger</i>.
</p>

 <p>
This past week reminded me of how fortunate I am to be able to share my time with both students and colleagues. May their time away from campus this week be filled with rest, joy, and a renewed sense of God’s gracious love.

  <title>Using Keynote in Class</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Nov 30, 2011 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Using Keynote in Class</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Nov 30, 2011 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
I have been using Keynote for iOS for lecture presentations in classes this semester. The process has been so easy, that this is the first semester that I have consistently used slide presentations during lectures. Most of my presentations were initially prepared on the Mac, then imported into Keynote for iOS on the iPad. Keynote for iOS seems to be fairly adept at importing transitions and effects. My only complaint is that the default font used in my preferred theme is different in the iOS version than in the desktop version of Keynote. 
</p>

 <p>
I use the Remote app on the iPhone as a presentation controller. I was a bit apprehensive at first. I have a Bluetooth presentation controller that I preferred to use in the past. I like having the hardware buttons for moving through the slides. That way, I could simply feel the button, change the slide, and never have to look at the controller. I find that I can do the same thing with the Remote app, however. Slide changes occur when the presenter swipes a finger across the screen, exactly like navigating through screens on an iOS device. I found that it is very natural to hold the phone in one hand, and swipe the screen with the index finger of that same hand to change the slide. A swipe in the other direction moves to the previous slide. There is no need to look at the phone to change slides. It is easy, natural, and I have yet to drop the phone after a semester’s worth of lectures. I can glance at the phone to see the next slide in the queue, a handy feature that my usual remote lacks.
</p>

 <p>
When I first started using the Remote app with Keynote for iOS, the two worked seamlessly. Both the iPad and iPhone were on the same wi-fi network, so the iPhone immediately saw the presentation that was running on the iPad. At some point, though, the two stopped connecting to each other. This began at the same time that I updated devices to iOS. Unfortunately, I don’t know if it is related to iOS or if it is a result of changes in the University’s network. I have found that connecting the iPad to the iPhone using the personal hotspot works flawlessly. That does require a few extra steps before the presentation can begin.
</p>

 <p>
Even so, I am extremely pleased with Keynote for iOS and the companion Remote app. I simply carry in the iPad and the adapter cable, plug it in to the projector cable, and begin the presentation. No boot-up time and not heavy laptop. It’s quick, easy, and it just works, assuming you pay AT&amp;T for the privilege of using your phone as a personal hotspot.

  <title>The Rights of Women in Afghanistan</title>

  <summary>Dec 07, 2011 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">The Rights of Women in Afghanistan</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Dec 07, 2011 00:00</p>
</header> <section id="outline-container-org03afd08" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="org03afd08">Cultural Relativism</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org03afd08">
 <p>
For many of those that hold the position, cultural relativism is motivated by a belief that we should be tolerant of the moral beliefs of other cultures. Most of the time, this is expressed in a way that is simply inconsistent, that is, given that there are no objective, universal moral truths, we  <i>ought</i> to be tolerant of the moral beliefs of other cultures. Unfortunately, one cannot consistently assert both that there are no objective, universal, moral truths and that we have a moral obligation to be tolerant, especially since our culture is often intolerant.
</p>
</div>
</section> <section id="outline-container-org7c1941e" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="org7c1941e">Options for the Relativist</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7c1941e">
 <p>
Even though relativists often are inconsistent, they need not be. Here are some ways that that one could try to assert a consistent relativism:
</p>


 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>When the relativist asserts that we ought to be tolerant, the assertion should not be understood as a moral claim. Instead, it should be understood as a pragmatic claim. That is, we ought to be tolerant, not because we are morally obligated to, but because it is in our best interests as a way of minimizing conflict.</li>
 <li>We shouldn’t adopt relativism because we have a moral duty to be tolerant, of course that is inconsistent. Rather, once our culture comes to realize the truth of cultural relativism, we would naturally come to adopt an ethic of tolerance. Then, it would be true that we ought to be tolerant, since it would be part of our moral code.</li>
 <li>When the relativist claims that we ought to be tolerant, she means simply that tolerance is a good. There is no need to understand this as a claim that tolerance is a  <i>moral</i> good. A good is simply something that is worth pursuing, and there are several reasons why tolerance would be something worth pursuing.</li>
</ul></div>
</section> <section id="outline-container-org0384c32" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="org0384c32">Tolerance Only to a Point?</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0384c32">
 <p>
I have argued elsewhere that tolerance is not as good as one might think, since it implies an attitude of superiority toward the one being tolerated. Even so, I think it is psychologically impossible for relativists to adopt an attitude of genuine tolerance toward the moral beliefs of cultures that are radically different from our own.
</p>

 <p>
For example, an Afghan woman reported that she was raped by her cousin’s husband two years ago, and she was subsequently sentenced to twelve years in prison ( <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/01/world/asia/afghanistan-rape-victim/index.html">see CNN’s coverage</a>). At first, it was reported that she would be released if she were to agree to marry her attacker, but authorities later said that the marriage was not a condition for her release. Even so, the imprisonment of a rape victim, who was then forced to care for her child in prison, is an unconscionable action according to most cultural relativists. That is, there are cultural beliefs and practices that should be changed, not simply tolerated.
</p>

 <p>
So, what moral beliefs should be tolerated? I suspect that the level of tolerance would be highly correlated with the degree of similarity to our own moral beliefs and practices. That is, the relativist would maintain that we ought to tolerate the beliefs and practices of other cultures so long as they are not too different from our own.
</p>

 <p>
That, however, is neither tolerance nor relativism. Instead, it is simply a thinly disguised moral realism.

A hundred mile journey <br></br>
from Nazareth to Bethlehem, <br></br>
taken at the whim <br></br>
of the emperor. <br></br></p>

 <p>
And two people, <br></br>
who never counted to Caesar, <br></br>
walked for days <br></br>
to be counted by Caesar.
</p>

 <p>
But Caesar rested easily in his palace, <br></br>
not feeling the earth tremble <br></br>
as the weight of the universe <br></br>
was laid in a manger.

  <title>A Parents Love</title>

  <summary>Jan 13, 2015 00:00</summary>

 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 13, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Saturday afternoon, protestors lined the bridge at Rogers Avenue and Interstate 44 in Lawton, Oklahoma. They held signs demanding that the children currently detained for illegal immigration be sent back to their home countries.
</p>

 <p>
 <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/07/17/332251674/as-immigration-crisis-grows-a-protest-movement-gains-steam">National Public Radio</a> recently reported on another protest:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
This week outside the southern Arizona town of Oracle, Marla and Bruce Bemis — along with several dozen of their neighbors — were lined up along a road waving American flags and holding signs, as patriotic music occasionally played in the background. Word had come that the federal government was planning to bring some of the detainees to a local academy for troubled youth.
</p>

 <p>
“You know it’s a shame that they’re kids, if they’re kids, but I guess their parents didn’t care that much to send them on that journey to here,” says Marla Bemis.
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
This brought to mind the story of Moses:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
A man from the family of Levi married a Levite woman. The woman became pregnant and had a son. She saw there was something special about him and hid him. She hid him for three months. When she couldn’t hide him any longer she got a little basket–boat made of papyrus, waterproofed it with tar and pitch, and placed the child in it. Then she set it afloat in the reeds at the edge of the Nile. (Exodus 2:1-3)
</p>
</blockquote>



 <p>
How much love must it take to send one’s child into the unknown? These are parents who care very much indeed.
</p>


 <p>
God of love, <br></br> <br></br>
Jesus took a little child <br></br>
into his arms, and said, <br></br>
“Whoever welcomes a child <br></br>
in my name, welcomes me.” <br></br> <br></br>
There are days <br></br>
when the Kingdom seems so near, <br></br>
but others when it seems so far. <br></br> <br></br>
Today, as the death toll rises <br></br>
in the land where <br></br>
the Prince of Peace once walked, <br></br>
help me to honor your words <br></br>
with more than just my lips. <br></br></p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>Charge to the Church</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jan 13, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Charge to the Church</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 13, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
 <i>For the NorthHaven Church Deacon Ordination Service</i> <br></br> <i>April 27, 2014</i>
</p>

 <p>
I have been asked to deliver a charge to the congregation on this occasion. A reasonable question to ask is why should the church be tasked with anything in the event of a deacon ordination? It is the new deacons that have been tasked to do something; the church is simply the recipient of those actions, isn’t it? So, what is the point of a charge to the church?
</p>

 <p>
Every charge to the church that I’ve heard has contained two important components, the charge to pray for deacons and their families and to support them in their ministry. Prayer is important to mention, but I won’t dwell on it, for I know that you have already begun to pray for these new deacons, just as you have been praying for our deacons ever since we established NorthHaven’s deacon ministry.
</p>

 <p>
Instead, I’d like to focus on the second aspect of the charge, the charge to support the deacons in their ministry. How, besides prayer, do we support those who minister, especially when they are ministering to us?
</p>

 <p>
There are two crucial ways, both exemplified by events in the life of Jesus. In John chapter 12, Mary, the sister of Martha and Lazarus, anointed Jesus’ feet with a pound of costly perfume. When one of the disciples objected, Jesus defended her action. Jesus allowed Mary to minister to him. Too often, though, we are like Peter, who, when Jesus knelt before him to wash his feet, initially refused Jesus the opportunity to minister. We refuse ministry for many reasons, sometimes pride, sometimes a sense of unworthiness, but often, I suspect, because of a feeling of self-sufficiency.
</p>

 <p>
The most important way to support those who minister is to allow them to be what God has called them to be. Despite our pride, none of us are ever really self-sufficient. If we were honest, we would have to confess that we are all, at different times, broken people in need of ministry. When we refuse ministry from one who has been called by God to serve, we, like Peter, refuse ministry from the Lord himself.
</p>

 <p>
So, we best support our deacons by allowing them to minister to our needs, but we must also lovingly help them understand those needs. In Mark 10, as Jesus was leaving Jericho on his final journey to Jerusalem, a blind man called out “Son of David, have mercy on me.” Jesus commanded the disciples to bring the man to him, then asked him directly, “What do you want me to do for you?” The man was neither too afraid, nor too embarrassed, to reply. James was speaking of other things when he said this, but his advice applies to ministry as well — you have not because you ask not. I have always been grateful for those who gently taught me how I should pray for them, and showed me the ways I could encourage them. Their guidance turned my fumbling attempts at ministry into something that we both needed.
</p>

 <p>
We tend to think of ministry as something that one person does for another, in other words, we think that there is one that actively gives and another that passively receives.  True ministry, though, depends as much on the one who receives as the one who provides. True ministry occurs when broken people together find healing in a community through which flows love, grace, hope, and faith. When we empower people to become what God has called them to be, a miracle happens, the Lord himself comes to us, walks among us, touches and heals us. May we, by God’s grace, be a community in which he is welcome. Let this be the charge. Will you accept?

Mitch opened his sermon at NorthHaven on Christ the King Sunday recounting the scene at the end of The Return of the King in which Aragorn, the newly crowned king, bows down to the hobbits. That brought to mind their first meeting in The Fellowship of the Ring where Frodo is trying to decide if Aragorn should be trusted:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
At last Frodo spoke with hesitation. “I believed that you were a friend before the letter came,” he said, “or at least I wished to. You have frightened me several times tonight, but never in the way the servants of the Enemy would, or so I imagine. I think one of his spies would - well, seem fairer and feel fouler, if you understand.”
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
What does a king look like?
</p>

 <p>
Is he haughty, <br></br>
unapproachable, <br></br>
controlling, <br></br>
and cold?
</p>

 <p>
Regal and magnificent, <br></br>
to be respected and admired, <br></br>
but only from afar?
</p>

 <p>
Majestic and powerful, <br></br>
a conquering hero <br></br>
who rides into the city <br></br>
astride a warhorse?
</p>

 <p>
Surely the king <br></br>
would not appear <br></br>
as the son of <br></br>
a poor family, <br></br>
a laborer with <br></br>
calloused hands?
</p>

 <p>
Homeless, <br></br>
who owns nothing, <br></br>
and rides into the city <br></br>
on a shabby, borrowed donkey?
</p>

 <p>
One who suffered injustice, <br></br>
and was executed by <br></br>
the forces of the state?
</p>

 <p>
Father,
</p>

 <p>
Teach me to <br></br>
embrace the King <br></br>
as he is, <br></br>
and not the King <br></br>
as I want him to be.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

Brian Partridge’s sermon this past Sunday was a perfect antidote to our annual festival of accumulation thinly disguised as a celebration of the birth of Christ. So, I guess I should stop browsing ebay.  Here is the prayer for the week:
</p>

 <p>
Holy God,
</p>

 <p>
Let me not be deceived; <br></br>
these things that I possess, <br></br>
do I use them, <br></br>
or do they use me?
</p>

 <p>
Help me to loosen my grip <br></br>
on that which I so tightly grasp, <br></br>
so that I can open my hands to you.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

An Apple education representative recommended the iOS app “Explain Everything.” I imported a Keynote presentation, talked through it, then posted the result to YouTube. It didn’t take any time at all. Explain Everything looks like it will be a great tool for anyone teaching in a distance learning context.

 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 13, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
For Sheri on her birthday:
</p>

 <p>
“Did you get <br></br>
a good-morning <br></br>
kiss?” <br></br></p>

 <p>
I ask.
</p>

 <p>
“No, I don’t think so.”
</p>

 <p>
You reply, <br></br>
even though I <br></br>
know that’s not true.
</p>

 <p>
Some couples won’t <br></br>
speak for years <br></br>
because of some <br></br>
small lie.
</p>

 <p>
So, how do <br></br>
I feel?
</p>

 <p>
Like a kid <br></br>
who just heard
</p>

 <p>
“No school - it’s <br></br>
a snow day today.” <br></br></p>

 <p>
Like a person <br></br>
who reached into <br></br>
his jacket pocket <br></br>
on the first day <br></br>
of fall,
</p>

 <p>
and pulled out <br></br>
two twenty-dollar <br></br>
bills.
</p>

 <p>
Those people just <br></br>
think they have <br></br>
all the luck.
</p>

 <p>
I know better <br></br>
though, <br></br></p>

 <p>
because it’s <br></br>
been over <br></br>
thirty years, <br></br></p>

 <p>
and
</p>

 <p>
just one kiss <br></br>
is still <br></br>
not enough.
</p>

Even though I fear the answer, <br></br>
I must still ask the question <br></br>
that was posed <br></br>
by the one who betrayed the Lord. <br></br> <br></br>
“Am I the one?” <br></br> <br></br>
Am I the one who <br></br>
sat in the comfort <br></br>
of the palace of the High Priest <br></br>
to plot your death <br></br>
because you were a threat <br></br>
to my religious authority? <br></br> <br></br>
Am I the one who <br></br>
from the confines of another palace <br></br>
washed my hands of you, <br></br>
preferring instead the <br></br>
power and prestige <br></br>
of my position? <br></br> <br></br>
Or am I the one <br></br>
who denied any <br></br>
knowledge of you, <br></br>
fearing what might happen <br></br>
if I should follow you to the cross? <br></br> <br></br>
Might I be the one <br></br>
full of sorrow, <br></br>
but devoid of hope, <br></br>
who wept in your presence, <br></br>
and watched you die? <br></br> <br></br>
On this day, <br></br>
Lord Jesus, <br></br>
We are all of these. <br></br> <br></br>
Put in our hands a crown of thorns, <br></br>
and show us again what Love can make <br></br>
with two pieces of wood and a few nails. <br></br> <br></br>
Christ have mercy on us, <br></br> <br></br></p>

What is it like <br></br>
to burn, <br></br>
but never burn up; <br></br>
to endure the pain <br></br>
of the flame, <br></br>
but never know <br></br>
the relief of destruction? <br></br> <br></br>
With no hope for the future, <br></br>
and no memory of their past, <br></br>
your people endured <br></br>
the burden of slavery; <br></br>
people who burn, <br></br>
but never burn up. <br></br> <br></br>
Then Moses heard a voice, <br></br>
saying, <br></br> <br></br>
“I see their misery; <br></br>
I hear their cries; <br></br>
indeed, I know their sufferings. <br></br>
Take off your shoes, <br></br>
for you stand on holy ground.” <br></br> <br></br>
Father, we confess <br></br>
that we are not like you. <br></br>
We see the suffering, <br></br>
we hear the cries, <br></br>
yet we do not feel the pain. <br></br> <br></br>
Open our eyes this week <br></br>
to the suffering <br></br>
of your world, <br></br>
and open our ears to the <br></br>
voice that cries from the cross, <br></br> <br></br>
May we remove our shoes, <br></br>
for we stand with those who suffer, <br></br>
in the shadow of the God who suffers with them. <br></br> <br></br></p>

  <title>Immersed in Love</title>

  <summary>Jan 13, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Immersed in Love</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 13, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Mitch Randall’s sermon Sunday was beautiful, the thought of being immersed in God’s love brought to mind both the final scene of Bergman’s  <i>Through A Glass Darkly</i> and the end of the “Cana of Galilee” chapter in  <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>.
</p>

 <p>
Father,
</p>

 <p>
I remember wearing a white robe, <br></br>
when I felt the water <br></br>
slipping over my face.
</p>

 <p>
Even through the water, <br></br>
I could hear the voice say, <br></br>
“Buried with him in baptism, <br></br>
and raised to walk in new life.”
</p>

 <p>
But it seems that the well of grace <br></br>
has since run dry, <br></br>
and the springs of faith <br></br>
have ceased to flow.
</p>

 <p>
Nothing is left <br></br>
but a dry, dusty heart <br></br>
and an old and bitter soul.
</p>

 <p>
But a heart can be cleansed, <br></br>
and a soul can be restored, <br></br>
indeed, all things become new <br></br>
when immersed in the ocean of your love.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

  <title>Love and Attention</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jan 13, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Love and Attention</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 13, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
A few days ago, Casie Trotter sent me this quote from George Saunders: “I think that art is a form of paying attention and, for me, attention is love.” This is an important point, although I would phrase it differently. Attention is not love, because attention can easily be followed by an act of hate. Attention is a necessary condition of love; it is impossible to love something unless on pays attention to the object of love. In the same way, it is impossible to hate something without also being willing to pay attention to it. Without attention, there is neither love nor hate, there is just indifference—the great sin of the Laodicean church.
</p>

 <p>
Traditionally, the theme of the second Sunday of Advent is love. Darley and Batson’s famous Good Samaritan study <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> shows that a major impediment to paying attention is simply being in a hurry. Ironically, then, the many activities and rushed pace of the Advent season make it harder for us to pay attention, and therefore less likely that Advent will be a season of love.
</p>

 <p>
Let us begin to love by paying attention.
</p>

 <p>
Holy Spirit,
</p>

 <p>
Forgive me, for <br></br>
although I can see, <br></br>
I am too often blind.
</p>

 <p>
Instead of obstacles in my path, <br></br>
let me see opportunities <br></br>
to slow down, <br></br>
to linger, <br></br>
to pay attention, <br></br>
to love.

What if Christian colleges and universities — even those affiliated with traditions with highly literalistic doctrines of creation — embraced a picture of unity in the body of Christ that included the concept of necessary loyal dissent within a framework of basic respect, transparency, and honest searching for truth?

The one who had already <br></br>
shed all the privileges of God, <br></br>
also shed his outer robe. <br></br>
Wrapping himself in a simple towel, <br></br>
he lovingly washed the disciples’ feet <br></br>
with his calloused hands. <br></br> <br></br>
Teach us, Lord, to shed <br></br>
our own trappings of power and prestige, <br></br>
as we reach out to those rejected by the world; <br></br>
and may we always have the grace to accept <br></br>
the things that you have had the grace to offer. <br></br> <br></br></p>

</header> <p>
God of creation,
</p>

 <p>
You gave us our first breath, <br></br>
Raised us up as we took our first feeble steps, <br></br>
Walked with us through the valleys of darkness, <br></br>
Comforted us during the times of loss, <br></br>
And you will welcome us into your arms when we pass from this life. <br></br> <br></br>
Today we remember those who have gone before, <br></br>
Those who have given their lives for their country’s sake, <br></br>
Those who sacrificed their own comfort so that others may prosper, <br></br>
And those who have cried out with our Lord from Gethsemane: <br></br>
“Not my will, but thine be done.” <br></br> <br></br> <br></br>
And so, <br></br>
Gracious God, <br></br>
We ask for strength, <br></br>
So that we may live lives <br></br>
Worthy of those who have gone before. <br></br> <br></br>
And may you accept the gifts we offer <br></br>
As a material symbol of a spiritual sacrifice, <br></br>
the sacrifice of our very lives. <br></br> <br></br>
For they are already yours, <br></br>
Redeemed by the shed blood and broken body <br></br>
Of our Lord Jesus Christ, <br></br>
In whose name we pray. <br></br></p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>Mercy, the Law, and Les Misérables</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jan 13, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Mercy, the Law, and Les Misérables</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 13, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Mitch Randall always seems to have some clever and interesting themes to use for his sermon series. In the past, we’ve had, among others, movies, board-games, and monsters. This summer, the series was called “NorthHaven Goes to Broadway.” Unfortunately, I missed most of it because of our vacation trip and military duty, but I was there this past Sunday for his sermon based on Les Misérables.
</p>

 <p>
I don’t know if she was doing it to spiritually prepare for Sunday, but Sheri, my wife, had been playing the 2012 film version over the past week. A few days ago, she pointed out that there is an ethical problem in the film—specifically, the conflict between mercy, on the one hand, and faithfulness to the law on the other.
</p>

 <p>
In Victor Hugo’s novel, Jean Valjean was an embittered ex-convict, unable to find food or lodging. When the the Bishop of Digne offered him shelter for the night, Valjean repaid him by stealing a set of expensive, extravagant silverware. The next morning, the police apprehended Valjean who told them an implausible story of how he had been given the silverware by the Bishop. When they dragged Valjean back to verify the story, we are given one of the most powerful scenes of grace found in literature:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
The door opened to disclose a dramatic group. Three men were holding a fourth by the arms and neck. The three were gendarmes; the fourth was Jean Valjean…
</p>

 <p>
’So here you are!’ he cried to Valjean. ’I’m delighted to see you. Had you forgotten that I gave you the candlesticks as well? They’re silver like the rest, and worth a good two hundred francs. Did you forget to take them?’
</p>

 <p>
Jean Valjean’s eyes had widened. He was now staring at the old man with an expression no words can convey…
</p>

 <p>
He fetched them from the mantelpiece and handed them to Valjean. The two women watched him do so without seeking by word or look to interfere. Valjean was trembling. He took the candlesticks mechanically and with a distracted air.
</p>

 <p>
’And now,’ said the bishop, ’go in peace. Incidentally, my friend, when next you come here you need not go through the garden. This door is never locked.’ He turned to the gendarmes. ’Thank you, gentlemen.’
</p>

 <p>
The gendarmes withdrew. Valjean stayed motionless as though he were on the verge of collapse. The bishop came up to him and said in a low voice:
</p>

 <p>
’Do not forget, do not ever forget, that you have promised me to use the money to make yourself an honest man.’
</p>

 <p>
Valjean, who did not recall having made any promise, was silent. The bishop had spoken the words slowly and deliberately. He concluded with a solemn emphasis:
</p>

 <p>
’Jean Valjean, my brother, you no longer belong to what is evil but to what is good. I have bought your soul to save it from black thoughts and the spirit of perdition, and I give it to God.’ <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
Jean Valjean was transformed, but like most transformations, it was not instantaneous—after he went on his way, in his confusion, he stole a coin from a boy. He soon realized what he had done, and attempted to return the coin, but the theft has already been reported. If he were caught, he would be sentenced to life as a repeat offender.
</p>

 <p>
Valjean adopted an alias and went on to forge a new life for himself. Eventually, he became a wealthy factory owner, the town mayor, and by all accounts, an honorable man. When Valjean learned that an innocent man faced punishment for Valjean’s past crimes, he went to court and proclaimed his true identity.
</p>

 <p>
This led to a series of arrests and escapes, and Valjeans constant pursuit by Javert, a fanatical police inspector, who seemed to seek only the enforcement of the law. At a critical point, Valjean had an opportunity to kill Javert, but instead, saved his life. Javert could not reconcile mercy and the law, and after this act of mercy on the part of Valjean, he could neither arrest Valjean nor let him go free. Javert’s only escape from his cognitive dissonance was suicide.
</p>

 <p>
In May, several news sources <sup> <a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> reported the story of the arrest of Cornealious Anderson. Anderson was convicted and sentenced when he was 23 for his role in a robbery. He was then told to wait for orders to report to prison, but those orders never came. He never hid his identity, and even asked his attorney what he should do. In the meantime, he married, raised four children, started and operated construction businesses, coached his son’s football team, and ran the video during the services of his church.
</p>

 <p>
When his original sentence was supposed to end, the state realized its clerical error. Anderson, through no fault of his own, had never served any part of his sentence. Eight US Marshals were immediately sent to his home to take him into custody.
</p>

 <p>
Should the state of Missouri have enforced the original sentence or should it have shown mercy? Does acting on one show no respect for the other?
</p>

 <p>
Judge Terry Brown of Mississippi County, Missouri freed Anderson after a ten minute hearing, and granted him time-served for his entire sentence—he walked out of the courtroom with his family and no requirement for parole. Anderson’s attorney said that the case shows that “justice can be swift, justice can be harsh, but justice also can be merciful.”
</p>

 <p>
There lies the solution to the problem. The law should serve the interests of justice. So, we shouldn’t ask if mercy is compatible with the law, but rather if mercy is compatible with  <b>justice</b>, and that depends on what justice is. Is justice an act of revenge upon the one who committed the wrong, or is justice an act of restoration?
</p>

 <p>
An act of robbery has many more victims than just the one who was robbed. The criminal obviously harmed the one who was robbed, but also harmed the greater community. This explains, at least in part, why the state, not just the individual, has in interest in the  prosecution of crime. Socrates thought that the greatest harm was done to offender himself, self-harm that consists in harm both to one’s moral personality and one’s relation to other members of the community.
</p>

 <p>
The restorative justice movement understands justice as the repairing of the harm that was caused by criminal act, the harm done to victims, the community, and also to the offenders. The goal of justice, then, is the restoration of community and the transformation of those involved.
</p>

 <p>
In the fictional case of Valjean and the actual case of Anderson, meeting the demands of the law would do more to harm the restoration of community than had already been achieved. So, in these cases, justice is not only compatible with mercy, but demands mercy. 
</p>

  <summary>Jan 13, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">New Friends</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 13, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
We met some very interesting people during our stay at the  <a href="http://www.ullikana.com">Ullikana Inn</a> in Bar Harbor, Maine. There were two couples there that, generally with some other couples, return every year. Before dinner, everyone met for some refreshments, during which they told about their usual evening activity at the inn. Evidently, the first time that the couples had been at the inn together, they found themselves in that room making the sort of small talk that people do when they don’t really know each other. Then, one asked, “What should we talk about?” Another answered, “How about what happens to you when you die.”
</p>

 <p>
After telling us this, one turned to me and said, “You bring the topic this evening. The only rule is that it has to be controversial.” Given that the Slender Man violence had been in the news, I asked if artists and writers had moral obligations that should govern how and what kinds of art are made available to the public. It was a very lively conversation that lasted more than two hours. Friends from different backgrounds, all discussing a controversial topic, with no one taking offense—it was a wonderful time.

 <i>For the Second Sunday of Pentecost</i>
</p>

 <p>
Isaiah spoke <br></br>
Of one who was <br></br>
Ugly, <br></br>
Despised, <br></br>
Rejected,
</p>

 <p>
One who knew pain, <br></br>
And suffering,
</p>

 <p>
One upon whom people would look, <br></br>
Then turn away in disgust.
</p>

 <p>
Yet it was our pain he bore, <br></br>
And our ugliness he assumed, <br></br>
Taking upon himself <br></br>
The shameful things inside <br></br>
That we keep hidden.
</p>

 <p>
We are like those <br></br>
Who saw only a homeless, itinerant Rabbi, <br></br>
But failed to see the one <br></br>
In whom the glory of God shone, <br></br>
When we see those who make us uncomfortable, <br></br>
And fail to see ones <br></br>
Whom you love <br></br>
And created in your image.
</p>

 <p>
God of grace and compassion, <br></br>
Forgive us. <br></br>
Open our eyes that we may see. <br></br>
Open our hearts that we may love.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

We hear Jesus say, <br></br> <br></br>
“Love your enemies, <br></br>
Turn the other cheek, <br></br>
Sell all you have, <br></br>
Give to the poor, <br></br>

We can’t, <br></br>

It’s impossible.” <br></br> <br></br>
Then Easter comes, <br></br>
And we are left speechless. <br></br> <br></br>

  <title>Reinstalling Apps from Mac App Store</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jan 13, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Reinstalling Apps from Mac App Store</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 13, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
I was having some trouble with BBEdit on one of my machines, so I decided to delete and reinstall the application. That’s not very difficult in ordinary circumstances, but since I bought from the App Store, it should have been even easier. There should be no need to enter any license information, just a click and install.
</p>

 <p>
First, I deleted the app. I deleted BBEdit from the applications folder. Somehow, it was still in Launchpad. So, I deleted it from Launchpad. Surely that would be enough.
</p>

 <p>
Unfortunately, after I deleted the application, the App Store still thought that it was installed and wouldn’t let me download another copy. With the aid of a great little application called  <a href="http://apps.tempel.org/FindAnyFile/">Find Any File</a>, I removed every trace of BBEdit from the machine, including all preference files and application support files.
</p>

 <p>
The App Store was still convinced that it was installed.
</p>

 <p>
Then, I began searching the internet, which revealed some frustrated App Store customers, who were mostly frustrated with their Xcode experience. The search didn’t help.
</p>

 <p>
For some reason, I decided to go back to Launchpad and saw the BBEdit icon there. I clicked it and BBEdit started right up, though without my usual color scheme since I had deleted the application support folder. So, where was the file? On a whim, I disconnected my backup drive, opened the App Store, and BBEdit was finally gone with the option to install. I Pressed the install button, and BBEdit was automatically installed.
</p>

 <p>
Lesson: Launchpad sees apps on external drives, so disconnect any external drives to install a deleted app to your main drive. Then, reinstalling  <i>should</i> be the quick and easy process that it’s supposed to be.

I use zsh instead of bash. If that doesn’t mean anything to you, then just skip the rest of this post. I’ve been restarting the terminal after every change to my zshrc file. I knew there had to be a way to quickly reload the file without restarting the terminal.
</p>

 <p>
It turns out that typing “. ~/.zshrc” will do it. The problem is that I’m not likely to remember it. I found this nice tip at  <a href="http://www.codem0nk3y.com/2012/12/how-to-reload-zsh-config/">codeM0nK3Y.com</a>: add the following to your zshconfig:
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="org0932615">
alias reload=". ~/.zshrc && echo 'ZSH config reloaded from ~/.zshrc'"
</pre>

 <p>
Now, just type “reload” and you’re all set.

  <title>Search and Replace with Regular Expressions</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jan 13, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Search and Replace with Regular Expressions</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 13, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
I wrote the post that follows below so that I could remember how to use regular expressions for search and replace operations in Sublime Text. Since I just now made some headway in Emacs, I’ll repost with some updates, again, primarily as a reference for myself.
</p>

 <p>
There is no doubt that regular expressions are very powerful. I’ve found that the documentation for regular expressions is often as mysterious as the things that the documentation is supposed to explain. Keeping in mind that I am certainly no expert, learning even a little about the use of regular expressions can be quite valuable.
</p>

 <p>
The normal search dialogue in text editors will find all uses of the search term. You might not want to find all uses of a term, but only those that match a certain pattern. For example, assume that I want to search for any dates in a long file. If the file contains many different dates, then searching successfully for each one would be tedious, if not impossible. If my dates are in the form “YYYY-MM-DD,” then I can simply use the regular expression “dddd-dd-dd”. The “d” finds a digit, so the search string locates every string of text that consists of four digits, followed by a hyphen, two digits, another hyphen, and ending with two digits.
</p>

 <p>
It could be that I wasn’t consistent in my dating scheme, some years have all four digits, and others have only two. The year could be first in some cases, but last in others. The search string “d&#42;-d&#42;-d&#42;” easily handles all of the variations. The asterisk is a repeat operator that matches the preceding character zero or more times. This search will find any three groups of digits separated by hyphens.
</p>

 <p>
Search with regular expressions is powerful enough, but replacement is amazing. Any string contained in parentheses can be referenced in both search and replacement strings. That makes it simple to change just part of a string.
</p>

 <p>
For example, imagine that I have a list of students that I copied from a database. Each line has the following format, “First Last”, and I want to change it to “Last, First”. The following regex search and replace accomplishes the task in one stroke:
</p>


 <pre class="example" id="org5cea71e">
Search: ^(w*) (w*)n
Replace: $2, $1n
</pre>


 <p>
This search finds every line consisting of just two words separated by a space. The <code>$1</code> refers to the string matched by the characters in the first set of parentheses, and <code>$2</code> refers to the string matched by the second set. The replacement string tells the editor to switch the words and insert a comma between them. This changes a list like this,
</p>


 <pre class="example" id="org7c382a9">
George Washington
John Adams
Thomas Jefferson
</pre>


 <p>
to
</p>


 <pre class="example" id="orgdb720a3">
Washington, George
Adams, John
Jefferson, Thomas
</pre>


 <p>
Imagine how difficult it would be to do this with a long file by cutting and pasting each name! Regular expressions can use Boolean operators, wildcards, and different character types. Different languages have their own particular syntaxes for regular expressions, and I assume that text editors might also have different syntaxes. The examples all work in Sublime Text 2. It’s well worth learning a little about how your preferred editor handles regular expressions, it can save a great deal of time and retyping.
</p>

 <p>
The primary difference in Emacs is in referencing the strings to be searched for and used in the replace operation. The key is to put a backslash (“\”) before the opening and closing parentheses in the search operation, and to use a backslash instead of a dollar sign in the replace operation. So, this will work for the preceding example:
</p>


 <pre class="example" id="orgb34a372">
Search: ^\(\w+\) \(\w+\)
Replace: \2, \1
</pre>

I added some variants to Brett Terpstra’s Marked.sublime-build file, which is part of the Marked  <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/introducing-the-marked-bonus-pack/">Bonus Pack</a>. It adds options for building tex, opml, and odf files.

  <title>Talking About Suicide</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jan 13, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Talking About Suicide</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 13, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
I was saddened to hear that Robin Williams died this week, apparently by suicide. I was also saddened to read how some people in faith communities reacted to the news. Some of these reactions struck me as callous, demonstrably false, or, at best, simply irrelevant.
</p>

 <p>
Over the past thirty years, I have known three soldiers who committed suicide, During my two deployments, I have been involved in more suicide interventions than I care to remember, and I regularly teach suicide prevention classes to Army units. To prepare for these classes, I always look at the latest studies, especially ones focusing on suicides in the military. The  <a href="http://www.armystarrs.org">Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers</a> is the largest ever conducted among military personnel, and will continue through 2015. Results are reported as they become available, and, so far, suggest that the problem is even worse in the Army than was previously thought. One thing is clear from the studies on suicide: suicide is a very complex problem, and there is no single determinant causal factor. So, any single-sentence explanation of a person’s death by suicide, no matter how effective that sentence is as a sound-bite, is nearly certain to be overly naïve and simplistic.
</p>

 <p>
Suicide prevention classes in the Army have mostly focused on identifying risk factors and warning signs and learning how to conduct an intervention. Risk factors are those qualities that make a problem more likely to occur, and warning signs are indicators that the problem is occurring. For example, high cholesterol is risk factor for heart attacks, while severe chest pain is a warning sign. The problem with just thinking in terms of risk factors and warning signs is that it doesn’t help us know what to do to avoid the problem. I know that I should avoid having high cholesterol levels, but how do I do that? Knowing the risk factors and warning signs for suicide is essential for crisis intervention, but that alone won’t necessarily help us prevent the crisis stage from occurring. We also need to think in terms of “protective” factors, those things that can be done to minimize the risk factors. The three major protective factors for suicide are effective mental health care, positive connections to high levels of interpersonal connectedness, and effective problem-solving skills. <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup></p>

 <p>
So, here are two things that I suggest to keep in mind when discussing suicide, or any other complex problem that affects people deeply.
</p>

 <ol class="org-ol"> <li>Remember Paul’s admonition in 1 Corinthians 6:12, “All things are lawful for me, but not all things are beneficial.” A lesson that I continually have to relearn is that not every opinion, even if true, should be shared. Will expressing this opinion will help lessen anyone’s pain, or will it simply contribute to the pain that is already there?</li>
 <li>Be willing to engage in some critical self-reflection on the extent to which our individual actions, community interaction, and public policies have contributed to the problem. Do we tend to isolate those who are hurting because they make us feel uncomfortable? Do our attitudes concerning mental illness discourage those who are hurting from seeking help? Is there sufficient public funding for mental health care?</li>
</ol> <p>
 <a href="http://themattwalshblog.com/2014/08/12/robin-williams-didnt-die-disease-died-choice/">Matt Walsh</a> recently stated that suicide is a spiritual problem. I think that is at least partly true, but maybe not for the reasons that he proposed. On one hand, since the common thread in most suicide cases is depression, the problem is a biological one—an illness for which there is treatment.
</p>

 <p>
On the other hand, the extent to which these protective factors are not present in our society  <b>is</b> a spiritual problem,  <i>our</i> spiritual problem. For Christians, the center of reality is a loving community, the Trinity, and our spiritual health is partly a function of how we reflect that love. So, today, and every day, I must ask myself if my words and actions demonstrate love and grace, or do they contribute to society’s tendency to become ever increasingly individualistic, egoistic, and unwilling to care for the least of these.
</p>

 <p>
This admonition from Teresa of Avila hangs on my office door, and seems to be appropriate for meditation today:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
Christ has no body now on earth but yours,   <br></br>
no hands but yours,   <br></br>
no feet but yours,   <br></br>
yours are the eyes through which Christ’s compassion   <br></br>
is to look out to the earth,   <br></br>
yours are the feet by which He is to go about doing good   <br></br>
and yours are the hands by which He is to bless us now.
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

Gracious God,
</p>

 <p>
In the events of this year, <br></br>
we see how fragile our lives truly are.
</p>

 <p>
Daily, we are faced with a choice <br></br>
to be people who live in cynicism and despair, <br></br>
or people who live in gratitude and thanksgiving.
</p>

 <p>
On this day, we choose gratitude over despair, <br></br>
and lift our hearts in thanksgiving to you, <br></br>
the one who is the source of all good things.
</p>

 <p>
Thank you <br></br>
for family and friends, <br></br>
for life and for love, <br></br>
and for the beauty that we would see <br></br>
if we would just open our eyes to you.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

Rousseau’s  <i>Social Contract</i> opens with “Man is born to be free, and everywhere he is in chains.” It’s amazing that he could recognize that without ever seeing a group of people with their smartphones.

  <title>The Eighteenth Sunday After Pentecost</title>

  <summary>Jan 13, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">The Eighteenth Sunday After Pentecost</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 13, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Holy God,
</p>

 <p>
Examine our hearts, <br></br>
and test our wills <br></br>
against your own. <br></br></p>

 <p>
We pray for the coming of your Kingdom <br></br>
here, on earth, <br></br>
even as it is in heaven. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Yet we confess that sometimes, <br></br>
these are just sounds made with our voices, <br></br>
not reflections of the desires of our hearts. <br></br>
For in that day, <br></br>
the high shall be brought down <br></br>
and the low shall be lifted up <br></br>
and compared to most, <br></br>
we live in power, prestige, and comfort.
</p>

 <p>
At other times, the words are sincere, <br></br>
a promise that we fear can never be fulfilled, <br></br>
for the death, sickness, pain, and loss often <br></br>
seem more real to us than the words that we pray. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Yet you know this, Lord, <br></br>
You know our deepest secrets, frailties, and deceits, <br></br>
and ask us to pray anyway, <br></br>
for our prayers may <br></br>
turn to hopes, <br></br>
our hopes, to dreams, <br></br>
and our dreams, <br></br>
to a new vision of what can truly be.
</p>

 <p>
May it begin, here, in this place, <br></br>
with us, your people, <br></br>
by the power of the Spirit, <br></br>
the abundant grace of the Father, <br></br>
and the sacrificial love of the Son.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

In response to a sermon on Daniel 3:
</p>

 <p>
How shall we respond to the furnaces of life? <br></br>
We make empty promises, saying that God must deliver, <br></br>
Mere feeble attempts to bind God’s will <br></br>
With pledges that we cannot guarantee.
</p>

 <p>
Instead, we are called to be strong and courageous, <br></br>
And if rescue is promised, <br></br>
Then of what value is courage?
</p>

 <p>
Lord, <br></br>
Give us the strength to face the flames <br></br>
Like the three in Babylon, <br></br>
Who dared not promise to show what God would do for them, <br></br>
But promised instead to show what they would do for God.

Another thought-provoking sermon at  <a href="http://northhavenchurch.net">NorthHaven</a> this week - this time, from Bryan Partridge. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Here is the prayer for the week:
</p>


 <p>
A good actor devotes herself to her role, <br></br>
and carefully learns her lines; <br></br>
while constantly studying the finest <br></br>
performances of the past. <br></br> <br></br>
At first, after many missed cues <br></br>
and fumbled lines, <br></br>
she fears she may never get it right. <br></br> <br></br>
But with wise direction, <br></br>
and hours of rehearsing, <br></br>
every word, <br></br>
and every gesture, <br></br>
eventually seems natural, <br></br>
as if she has finally become <br></br>
what she was always meant to be. <br></br> <br></br>
And the role, <br></br>
performed countless times by others, <br></br>
is now hers, <br></br>
something new, <br></br>
and beautiful - <br></br> <br></br>
A work of art <br></br>
taken to the stage, <br></br>
and performed for the pleasure <br></br>
of the audience. <br></br> <br></br> <br></br>
Father, <br></br> <br></br>
We place ourselves <br></br>
under your direction, <br></br>
as we seek to grow <br></br>
into this role, <br></br>
which you have given us - <br></br>
to be disciples of Christ. <br></br> <br></br>
And with time, <br></br>
may we each create something <br></br>
unique and beautiful <br></br>
for your good pleasure. <br></br></p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

Lord Jesus, <br></br> <br></br>
What kind of king are you? <br></br></p>

 <p>
The kingdoms of this earth <br></br>
Pride themselves on their power, <br></br>
Their majesty, <br></br>
Their influence, <br></br>
And their wealth. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Yet you say that your kingdom is like <br></br>
A small seed, <br></br>
Yeast, <br></br>
And a net. <br></br></p>

 <p>
May your kingdom fill our lives <br></br>
As the yeast permeates the dough. <br></br>
As we grow from this small seed <br></br>
May we provide shelter and shade to those in need, <br></br>
Yet remaining rooted in you, <br></br>
And drawing nourishment from your compassion. <br></br></p>

 <p>
And when the day comes, <br></br>
We pray that you will <br></br>
Catch us in your net of love, <br></br>
Drawing us to our eternal home <br></br>
In your arms. <br></br> <br></br> <i>Amen</i>

  <title>The Fourteenth Sunday After Pentecost</title>

I love it when a minister points out something that I had never noticed in the text. Mitch Randall certainly did that this past Sunday. So, this prayer recalls Daniel’s action to save his competitors in Babylon as recounted in Daniel 2.
</p>

 <p>
If there is to be a winner, <br></br>
there must be a loser. <br></br>
or so it goes in the games we play, <br></br>
in games of sport, <br></br>
and in games of life.
</p>

 <p>
The clever person ensures success <br></br>
by eliminating the competition.
</p>

 <p>
Guns and knives are too crude <br></br>
for our sophisticated times, <br></br>
instead we use words <br></br>
to harm reputations <br></br>
and rumors to destroy characters.
</p>

 <p>
And then, in the end, <br></br>
we can rest content <br></br>
in victory, <br></br>
isolated and alone.
</p>

 <p>
Lord,
</p>

 <p>
Bid us again <br></br>
to play in your fields, <br></br>
where contact is <br></br>
not hand-to-hand, <br></br>
but hand-in-hand.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

Holy God,
</p>

 <p>
For those times <br></br>
when we hear <br></br>
the ridicule, <br></br>
the jeers, <br></br>
the insults, <br></br>
and see the looks <br></br>
of pain and loneliness, <br></br>
yet stand in uncomfortable silence, <br></br>
and do nothing,
</p>

 <p>
Lord have mercy.
</p>

 <p>
And for those times <br></br>
when we strike back <br></br>
at those who hurt us, <br></br>
and start another <br></br>
cycle of violence <br></br>
that has no end in sight,
</p>

 <p>
Christ have mercy.
</p>

 <p>
The powerful rested <br></br>
easy on their thrones, <br></br>
when the things of God <br></br>
were bought and sold <br></br>
on the marketplace; <br></br>
for the temple <br></br>
was their palace, <br></br>
and its religion <br></br>
was their power.
</p>

 <p>
Lord Jesus, <br></br>
storm into our lives <br></br>
as you did the temple; <br></br>
may the chains be broken, <br></br>
the tables turned, <br></br>
and our hearts set free.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

God of grace and love, <br></br> <br></br>
History is filled <br></br>
With names like <br></br>
Alexander, <br></br>
Hannibal, <br></br>
Caesar, <br></br>
Napoleon; <br></br>
Men who took up arms, <br></br>
And with violence, <br></br>
Bent the world to their will. <br></br> <br></br>
But history whispers <br></br>
Of others, <br></br>
The faceless ones, <br></br>
Who were deemed <br></br>
To insignificant to name. <br></br> <br></br>
We think of the woman <br></br>
Who, with her daughter, <br></br>
Gave her son to the Nile, <br></br>
Yet found a way to get him back, <br></br>
And by saving her son, <br></br>
Saved a people from their bondage. <br></br> <br></br>
The world sees those <br></br>
Who bear swords, <br></br>
And calls them heroic. <br></br>
What greater courage <br></br>
Has the one <br></br>
Who faces the sword <br></br>
With compassion and love? <br></br></p>

 <p>
Amen

Here I am, Lord, <br></br>
asking for just <br></br>
one more chance.
</p>

 <p>
Why do you continue to use me?
What good am I to you?
</p>

 <p>
I am a <br></br>
flawed, <br></br>
broken, <br></br>
undependable <br></br>
tool.
</p>

 <p>
One that makes mistakes, <br></br>
and asks for second chances.
</p>

 <p>
But I hear a gentle voice <br></br>
whispering a message of hope, <br></br>
that my heart longs to hear…
</p>

 <p>
That even a flawed and broken tool <br></br>
can make something beautiful <br></br>
when it’s used by the master.

When we discuss the concept of rights in political philosophy, I confess that I feel conflicted. On one hand, the recognition of, and commitment to, the rights of others is essential to treating them with the dignity that is due to one created in the image of God. On the other hand, the constant practice of demanding my own rights does not seem consistent with the claim to follow the one that Paul described in Philippians 2:
</p>


 <blockquote>
 <p>
Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus, <br></br>
who, though he was in the form of God, <br></br>
did not regard equality with God <br></br>
as something to be exploited, <br></br>
but emptied himself, <br></br>
taking the form of a slave, <br></br>
being born in human likeness. <br></br>
And being found in human form, <br></br>
he humbled himself <br></br>
and became obedient to the point of death— <br></br>
even death on a cross.
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
Philippians 2:6-8 (NRSV)
</p>

 <p>
So, yesterday’s sermon on entitlement by Mitch Randall at [NorthHaven Church]( <a href="http://northhavenchurch.net">http://northhavenchurch.net</a> ) was particularly convicting. Here is the prayer that it prompted:
</p>

 <p>
 <i>The petty heart</i> <br></br> <i>feels entitled to everything,</i> <br></br> <i>and finds grace in nothing.</i> <br></br></p>

 <p>
 <i>Blessed is the one</i> <br></br> <i>who feels entitled to nothing,</i> <br></br> <i>but finds grace in everything.</i>
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

 <i>A prayer prompted by the deacon ordination service at NorthHaven Church, April 27, 2014.</i>
</p>

 <p>
Lord Jesus,
</p>

 <p>
Children take what is given them <br></br>
With joy and gratitude, <br></br>
Without pretense, <br></br>
Never second-guessing <br></br>
The motives of the giver.
</p>

 <p>
You told us that we must <br></br>
Receive the Kingdom as a little child, <br></br>
Yet our pride keeps us from accepting <br></br>
That which you offer by the hands of your servants. <br></br>
Teach us to receive the gifts of ministry <br></br>
That you so graciously provide.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

We missed worship at NorthHaven this past Sunday, although I hear that there was an exceptional sermon by Bryan Partridge. Instead, I was at the 2014 meeting of the Baptist Association of Philosophy Teachers. A common theme of the presentations that I heard was the virtue of humility, one that seems often missing from academic life. This week’s prayer:
</p>


 <p>
Holy God,
</p>

 <p>
Protect me from the temptation <br></br>
to mistake sarcasm for honesty, <br></br>
cynicism for realism, <br></br>
and cleverness for wisdom.
</p>

 <p>
Cleanse my heart from anything <br></br>
that keeps me from loving <br></br>
and learning from everyone <br></br>
that you place in my path, <br></br>
especially those that make me uncomfortable.
</p>

 <p>
Teach me to rejoice in the differences, <br></br>
for what can I learn <br></br>
from those that already <br></br>
think as I do, <br></br>
believe as I do, <br></br>
and speak as I do?
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

We say that God helps those who help themselves, <br></br>
that cleanliness is next to godliness, <br></br>
that money is the root of all evil, <br></br>
that God will not give us more than we can handle, <br></br>

As I was driving to work this morning, the person behind me honked as I was waiting for a pedestrian to cross the street at a marked crosswalk. I was still fuming and telling myself that I wish I could have told them what I really thought as they pulled into the parking space beside me. Fortunately, I had just heard Mitch Randall’s sermon on Daniel in the lions’ den the day before. With that said, here is the prayer for the week:
</p>

 <p>
Lord,
</p>

 <p>
It seems like I’m always in the lions’ den.
</p>

 <p>
I tell myself that I’m Daniel, <br></br>
a man of faith who was slandered by the envious, <br></br>
the righteous one who was unjustly attacked by his enemies.
</p>

 <p>
I can fool myself, Lord, <br></br>
but surely I’m not fooling you.
</p>

 <p>
Most of the time, <br></br>
I’m one of the lions. <br></br>
Ready at any time to open my mouth <br></br>
to tear down, <br></br>
to hurt, <br></br>
to wound, <br></br>
to destroy.
</p>

 <p>
And when I lack the ability to shut my own mouth, <br></br>
please shut it for me, <br></br>
until it’s filled with words <br></br>
that proclaim <br></br>
justice, <br></br>
healing, <br></br>
mercy, <br></br>
and love.
</p>

 <p>
Then, loosen my lips, <br></br>
so that the stream of mercy and love <br></br>
can flow from you, through me, <br></br>
and transform the lions’ den <br></br>
into a sanctuary of your grace.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

</header> <p>
God of grace,
</p>

 <p>
We live in a word of concrete barricades, wooden fences, and stone walls that we have built to protect, separate, control, and hide; some hastily thrown up in hours, others carefully built in weeks or months.
</p>

 <p>
Other walls, though, are constructed over a lifetime, and are just as real and just as effective—downcast eyes, hostile stares, and stony silence—walls constructed to prevent the pain of rejection, or to keep others out of our comfortable lives.
</p>

 <p>
Yet we dream of a place where the barricades can be taken down, a place without fear, hunger, want, or need; a place with neither revenge nor retribution, for there are no wrongs to made right; a world filled with peace, justice, love, and grace—not another world, but this world, transformed and redeemed.
</p>

 <p>
How can we build such a world when we only know how to build walls?
</p>

 <p>
Lord have mercy on us.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

 <i>On the Tenth Anniversary of NorthHaven Church</i>
</p>

 <p>
For those who have given much <br></br>
And have gone on to their eternal rest, <br></br>
We give thanks.
</p>

 <p>
For those who labor joyfully <br></br>
So that others may see Jesus, <br></br>
We give thanks.
</p>

 <p>
For both laughter and tears, <br></br>
When shared with those who love deeply, <br></br>
We give thanks.
</p>

 <p>
And for a church where Christ is proclaimed <br></br>
Yet an Imam feels welcome, <br></br>
We give thanks.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>


 <p>
“Now that you have purified your souls by your obedience to the truth so that you have genuine mutual love, love one another deeply from the heart.” (1 Peter 1:22)

Sheri and I recently spent the weekend with some soldiers from my Afghanistan deployment and their families. I wrote this prayer after reflecting on the experience:
</p>


 <p>
God of promise and hope, <br></br></p>

 <p>
We give thanks today for shared memories. <br></br></p>

 <p>
The stories bring healing <br></br>
as they are told and retold, <br></br>
for they remind us <br></br>
that joy is found in surprising places. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Cherish our remembering, <br></br>
and strengthen our minds <br></br>
as the years pass, <br></br>
for you are God, our God, <br></br>
who forgets no one. <br></br></p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

Loving God,
</p>

 <p>
Apathy is a vice <br></br>
easily disguised <br></br>
behind veils <br></br>
of busy lives, <br></br>
carefully built <br></br>
to avoid the <br></br>
demands of love.
</p>

 <p>
Forgive me, <br></br>
not just because <br></br>
I pretend to care, <br></br>
but that I <br></br>
deceive myself - <br></br>
believing in <br></br>
the pretending <br></br>
more than <br></br>
in the caring.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>The Twentieth Sunday After Pentecost</title>

 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 13, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
I want a faith <br></br>
that is like <br></br>
a good pair of shoes.
</p>

 <p>
Comfortable, <br></br>
not too demanding, <br></br>
painless, <br></br>
and safe…
</p>

 <p>
Easy to forget…
</p>

 <p>
The kind you never <br></br>
know is there, <br></br>
with just a little Jesus, <br></br>
and not too much of the Spirit.
</p>

 <p>
A faith that trusts, <br></br>
but not too much. <br></br>
A faith that dreams, <br></br>
but not too big.
</p>

 <p>
But the living God <br></br>
does not deal in small faith <br></br>
and small dreams.
</p>

 <p>
So, here I am, Lord, <br></br>
opening up the dry, <br></br>
dusty corners of my heart.
</p>

 <p>
Let the river flow.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

This is a prayer I wrote for the Christmas special at NorthHaven Church today:
</p>

 <p>
Holy God,
</p>

 <p>
Once again, <br></br>
the angels invite us <br></br>
to come, <br></br>
behold, <br></br>
and adore.
</p>

 <p>
Now may your spirit of peace <br></br>
quiet our minds, <br></br>
prepare our hearts, <br></br>
and open our eyes <br></br>
this Christmas season <br></br>
that we may see <br></br>
the beauty of the Savior <br></br>
as if for the very first time.
</p>

 <p>
And then, as we run to Bethlehem in joy <br></br>
to worship the newborn King, <br></br>
may we do so <br></br>
knowing that the tiny arms <br></br>
that reached out to Mary <br></br>
are the same arms that were stretched out <br></br>
to redeem the world;
</p>

 <p>
And the song that the angels sang <br></br>
is but a shadow of the one <br></br>
that all creation will sing <br></br>
in the world to come:
</p>

 <p>
Gloria in excelsis Deo,
</p>

 <p>
Glory, <br></br>
Glory, <br></br>
Glory to God in the highest!
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

  <title>Thoughts on Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jan 13, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Thoughts on Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 13, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Social media was certainly inundated with  reactions to yesterday’s Supreme Court ruling in  <i>Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby</i>. The majority were at the two extremes — either this was a great victory for religious liberty and a stunning blow to the Obama administration, or it was an unprecedented power-grab by religious conservatives and wealthy corporate America that will only prevent women from getting the health care that they need.
</p>

 <p>
As is generally the case, neither extreme position is correct. The  <i>Affordable Care Act</i> is safe, and only certain corporations will be exempt from providing health coverage in very limited instances, provided that the government can easily provide such coverage. So, I don’t think that the situation is as bad as some progressives have concluded.
</p>

 <p>
That’s not to say that I think that the situation is good. I fear that the Supreme Court has placed the government in the position of having to determine what counts as a sincerely held religious belief, which may have more far-reaching implications for religious liberty than simply having to provide comprehensive health coverage.
</p>

 <p>
In any case, this is just one of the problems with linking health-coverage and employment. The solution to this and other problems, including the exorbitantly high cost of health care in the United States compared to other countries, is to adopt a single-payer system. 
</p>

</header> <p>
Lord,
</p>

 <p>
Stay with me <br></br>
for a moment <br></br>
while I divide <br></br>
up my life.
</p>

 <p>
I’ll give you Sunday, <br></br>
but I’m keeping <br></br>
Monday through Saturday.
</p>

 <p>
I’ll give you ten percent, <br></br>
so long as you don’t <br></br>
ask what I do with <br></br>
the other ninety.
</p>

 <p>
I’ll do whatever you ask, <br></br>
just don’t make any <br></br>
unreasonable demands.
</p>

 <p>
Then, in the stillness, <br></br>
I hear a quiet voice <br></br>
whisper the question <br></br>
I’m afraid to answer:
</p>

 <p>
“Why do you call me ‘Lord?’”
</p>

 <p>
Lord, have mercy.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>Twenty-Second Sunday After Pentecost</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Twenty-Second Sunday After Pentecost</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 13, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Merciful God,
</p>

 <p>
This day marks the end of the war <br></br>
that was to be the last. <br></br>
That we thought it so was just <br></br>
another sign of our arrogance. <br></br></p>

 <p>
We use this day now <br></br>
to give thanks for <br></br>
those who have served.
</p>

 <p>
And as we remember them, <br></br>
let us not do so <br></br>
through the eyes of the world, <br></br>
which values only <br></br>
security, <br></br>
power, <br></br>
and wealth.
</p>

 <p>
Let us look instead <br></br>
through the eyes of <br></br>
the Crucified One, <br></br>
who looks upon us <br></br>
with <br></br>
humility, <br></br>
sacrifice, <br></br>
and love.
</p>

 <p>
For it is only then <br></br>
that we understand <br></br>
the cost borne <br></br>
by those who have <br></br>
“No greater love <br></br>
than this.”
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

  <title>Emacs Blog Test</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Emacs Blog Test</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 16, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
I’m testing blogging to the new Jekyll blog from Emacs using the Lisp code from  <a href="https://www.miskatonic.org/2014/01/26/more-about-emacs-and-jekyll/%20">William Denton</a>.
It works extremely well. I had to remap the key definitions since  <code>C-c j</code> was already used for something else in my configuration. It’s bad Emacs form, but I used  <code>C-x j</code> instead. So,  <code>C-x j n</code> asks for a post title, then creates a file in the drafts folder with the front matter already inserted. When ready to publish,  <code>C-x j t</code> inserts the time stamp, and  <code>C-x j p</code> renames the file using the time stamp and moves it into the posts folder.  <code>C-x j o</code> opens the site folder in a dired buffer.

  <title>Why Jekyll?</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Why Jekyll?</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 17, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <section id="outline-container-org2058988" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="org2058988">Same Old Story</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2058988">
 <p>
It must be that time of year again — the time that I do something new with the blog. I’m not sure that I could remember all of the tools that I’ve used to build web sites in the past:
</p>

 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>Microsoft FrontPage (Those were dark days, indeed.)</li>
 <li>Something that I vaguely remember being produced by Netscape</li>
 <li>RapidWeaver</li>
 <li>Blogger</li>
 <li>RubyFrontier</li>
 <li>Wordpress</li>
 <li>Octopress</li>
 <li>Statamic</li>
 <li>Ghost</li>
 <li>Squarespace</li>
</ul> <p>
I’m probably forgetting something, but you get the point. The problem is that none of these met all of my criteria for a good system. The last four are definitely viable, each have strengths and weaknesses. With Wordpress, Ghost, and Squarespace, I was able to post from my iPad when I didn’t have access to the computer. With Octopress, I was able to keep an up-to-date copy of all posts in their native Markdown format. Posting from iOS with Octopress was possible, but tricky. With Squarespace, I could write the original post in my preferred text editor, then copy and paste into the Markdown field. If I later edited the post online, I would have to remember to update the stored file on the computer. I could download a backup, but it was an XML file, no longer Markdown. Statamic is a good solution, and if I had to design a site for a non-tech-savvy client, I would probably go with it.
</p>
</div>
</section> <section id="outline-container-orgac2530e" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="orgac2530e">What I’m Looking For</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgac2530e">
 <p>
Here are the features I wanted:
</p>

 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>Inexpensive — I teach at a private, tuition-driven, liberal arts college.</li>
 <li>Write in Markdown.</li>
 <li>Write with Emacs.</li>
 <li>Use some Markdown extension for footnotes <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> and tables.</li>
 <li>Typeset math with MathJax.</li>
 <li>Easily keep an updated copy of all posts in their native format.</li>
 <li>Occasionally write and publish a post with my iPad.</li>
 <li>Control over the aesthetics of the site.</li>
</ul> <p>
 <a href="http://scriptogr.am">Scriptogram</a> looked ideal, with posts built from Markdown files kept in Dropbox. The problem is that services like Scriptogram have been shutting down, because they weren’t sustainable. There are some services that looked like they had a plan for sustainability, like  <a href="https://www.silvrback.com ">Silvrback</a> and  <a href="https://posthaven.com ">Posthaven</a>, but they didn’t seem to meet my needs any better than Ghost.
</p>

 <p>
I copied everything from Squarespace and built an Octopress site, deciding to live with the mobile posting problem. Octopress seems to take a bit of time to build, which could be annoying as the site gets larger, but that’s a minor complaint.  <a href="http://hexo.io ">Hexo</a> is fast, but most of the users seem to be Chinese, and like Blanche DuBois, I tend to rely on the kindness of strangers, at least I rely on others to have written about how to solve certain problems.
</p>
</div>
</section> <section id="outline-container-org38f4d22" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="org38f4d22">Jekyll to the Rescue</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org38f4d22">
 <p>
I’ve played with  <a href="http://jekyllrb.com ">Jekyll</a> in the past, but didn’t find it very friendly unless packaged in Octopress. I decided to give Jekyll another try. It turned out to be fairly easy to set up, and I believe it has all of the features that I wanted. I’m publish to Github Pages, so it’s free. I’m using an extension of Markdown called Kramdown that has footnotes, tables, and MathJax support. I not only have a local copy of my posts, but they’re all under version control, backed up on Github. I found a very nice theme that I was able to use to fairly closely replicate my Squarespace site. Finally, I can write and publish a post on the Github web site, which is then copied to my computer the next time I publish. Of course, Emacs is able to automate much of the process.
</p>

 <p>
So, here is the new Jekyll site.
</p>

 <p>
UPDATE: I should have mentioned that the day I deployed the new Jekyll site, Brandon Mathis posted information about  <a href="http://octopress.org/2015/01/15/octopress-3.0-is-coming/">Octopress 3</a>.
</p>

It sounds interesting, and I’ll have to keep an eye on it. I saw  <a href="http://www.websrvr.in/?utm_source=getsimpleform.com&utm_medium=nav&utm_campaign=simpleform1%20">websrvr</a> this morning. It builds from Dropbox, but is a paid service, so it might be something that sticks around. <sup> <a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> It certainly looks worth a test run.

  <title>My New Jekyll Site</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jan 18, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">My New Jekyll Site</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 18, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Jekyll was remarkably simple, much more than I expected. A competent person should be able to deploy a new Jekyll site in minutes. I, in usual fashion, took six hours. Here is a record of what I did, both what worked and what did not.
</p>
 <section id="outline-container-orgf8b4cdf" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="orgf8b4cdf">The Steps, Both True and Errant</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf8b4cdf">
</div>
 <div id="outline-container-org5ba1d1b" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="org5ba1d1b">Install Jekyll</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5ba1d1b">
 <p>
The first step is to install  <a href="http://jekyllrb.com ">Jekyll</a>. Since it’s a Ruby Gem, it’s very easy to install. I then built the default site, but it wasn’t quite the style I wanted. I saw this article by  <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/">Barry Clark</a>, which led me to  <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now%20">Jekyll Now</a>, which was a full-fledged starter site, but still not the style that I wanted.  <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com ">Jekyll Bootstrap</a> is good for those who like Twitter Bootstrap, but I didn’t need anything like that. Then, I saw something titled “How I Created a Beautiful and Minimal Blog Using Jekyll, Github Pages, and poole” by  <a href="http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/%20">Joshua Lande</a>. That seemed to be exactly what I wanted.
</p>
</div>
</div>
 <div id="outline-container-org595680b" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="org595680b">Poole and Lanyon</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org595680b">
 <p>
 <a href="http://getpoole.com">Poole</a> provided a very nice minimalist site. When I went to the Poole site, I saw two themes. I really liked Lanyon, but couldn’t figure out how to install a theme on top of Poole. After an embarrassing amount of time, I realized that the theme, Lanyon, already contained Poole. So, installing it was just a matter of downloading it.
</p>
</div>
</div>
 <div id="outline-container-orgd78db8f" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="orgd78db8f">Configure the Site</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd78db8f">
 <p>
Configuring the site is simple. There are a few items to add to the _config.yml file in the root directory of the site, mostly standard things like the site title and base URL. Then, just run `jekyll server` from the root directory of the site, browse to  <code>http://localhost:4000</code>, and you should see your new site.
</p>
</div>
</div>
 <div id="outline-container-org7f78574" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="org7f78574">Deployment</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7f78574">
 <p>
Deploying a Jekyll site is pretty easy; how it’s done depends on where it’s hosted. Github, besides having the best price (free!), it’s also the easiest way to serve up a Jekyll site. Just name the repository <username>.github.io, and Github builds it and serves it automatically. After downloading and configuring Lanyon, I created a Git repository, and started to push that to Github, and… decided that this was a waste of time. Since Lanyon is hosted on Github, I forked Lanyon, changed the repository name, and cloned it. Then, I updated config.yml, browsed to rlridenour.github.io, and saw my home page.
</p>
</div>
</div>
 <div id="outline-container-org4f7af9e" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="org4f7af9e">Styling the Site</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4f7af9e">
 <p>
This cost met some time, but only because of some poor initial choices on my part. Lanyon is built on Poole, and there were three CSS files, one each for Poole, Lanyon, and one called syntax.css. Some things that I wanted changed were in the Poole css file, others were in the Lanyon file. So, I proceeded to change things in both files. Then, it struck me that any update to either Poole or Lanyon would create a host of problems trying to figure out what needed to be changed again. So, I scrapped everything, started over, and just copied what the items I wanted to change to a new css file, then loaded that file last. Later, I moved them all to an SCSS directory, since Jekyll uses both SASS and CoffeeScript, and changed the config file to minimize the CSS file. At this point, my SCSS files are just the original CSS files with the extension changed.
</p>
</div>
</div>
 <div id="outline-container-orga55e4fe" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="orga55e4fe">Archive and Tag Pages</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga55e4fe">
 <p>
I blatantly copied  <a href="http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/%20">Joshua Lande’s</a> archive page and  <a href="http://blog.lanyonm.org/articles/2013/11/21/alphabetize-jekyll-page-tags-pure-liquid.html%20">Michael Lanyon’s</a> tag page. I don’t know if I’ll add any search function, the tag page is probably a better way to find content.
</p>
</div>
</div>
 <div id="outline-container-org7d11ae4" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="org7d11ae4">Final Details</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7d11ae4">
 <p>
I added Disqus commenting, which  just a matter of copying some code from Disqus and copying it to the post layout file. I also added a reference to the MathJax script to the head.
</p>
</div>
</div>
 <div id="outline-container-org8e486b8" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="org8e486b8">Finished</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8e486b8">
 <p>
Now, the site is up, and it just needs some more content. We’ll see how long that takes.

  <title>Christmas Prayer</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jan 20, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Christmas Prayer</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 20, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
This was a prayer I delivered at NorthHaven Church in Norman for the Christmas Day service on December 25, 2011. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Gracious Father,
</p>

 <p>
We gather here in this place to celebrate the day the world changed. <br></br>
On that day, one who was pure spirit became incarnate; <br></br>
The eternal Word became clothed in a frail human body; <br></br>
That which no human had ever touched was laid by a gentle mother’s hand into a simple manger; <br></br>
The eternal and timeless now had a beginning; <br></br>
The infinite became finite; <br></br>
On that day, God became human.
</p>

 <p>
While still in the garden, we began to build a wall; <br></br>
A wall that separated ourselves from you; <br></br>
A wall which we built, but could never tear down. <br></br></p>

 <p>
You tore down the wall when you brought your firstborn into the world, <br></br>
and said to that babe in the manger, <br></br></p>

 <p>
“You are my son; this day I have begotten you.”
</p>

 <p>
You have spoken to us in many ways, through the prophets, through the beauty of nature, and through the voice of conscience.
</p>

 <p>
On that first Christmas day, though, you spoke has you had never spoken before.
</p>

 <p>
Lord, here we are, <br></br>
Help us to listen, <br></br>
Help us to hear.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

  <title>NRA Survey</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jan 20, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">NRA Survey</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 20, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
I just received a call from the National Rifle Association today. A recorded message from the NRA Executive Vice-President concerning the U.N. Small Arms Treaty was followed by the following single question survey:
</p>

 <p>
“Do you think it’s OK for the U.N. to be on our soil attacking our gun rights?”
</p>

 <p>
I was instructed to press “1” if I did  <i>not</i> think was OK for the U.N. to be on our soil attacking our gun rights. That was followed by a repeat instruction to press “1” if I did not think it was OK. I was then instructed to press 2 if I did think was OK for the U.N. to attack our gun rights. (Note that I was only given that instruction once.)
</p>

 <p>
I am not criticizing the NRA’s position on the U.N. Small Arms Treaty, primarily since I have no interest in making enemies of the most well-armed group in the country. NRA membership outnumbers the people serving the U.S. Armed Forces by over a million. Even if there are no problems with the policy position, there are several problems with the survey. First, it is obvious that the NRA is not concerned what people think about the treaty. The survey is a classic example of a push-poll. It’s designed simply to push a message out to the population. This is evident from the question. What useful information do we expect to gain from asking people if they think it’s OK for the U.N to attack our gun rights. Do we really not know how people will answer that question? It’s no different from my polling my students to find out if they would like to get out of class early. I expect to soon hear an announcement from the NRA proclaiming that the American people are nearly unanimous in their rejection of the Small Arms Treaty. As far as information gathering goes, it’s a complete waste of time and money. For propaganda pushing, on the other hand, it’s very effective.
</p>

 <p>
I wonder what the response rate would have been had the question been “Do you think it’s OK that the U.N. negotiate a treaty designed to prevent guns from falling into the hands of terrorists?” Another group could report that the American people nearly unanimously support the Small Arms Treaty. This survey would be no better as a survey, but just as effective as a propaganda tool.
</p>

 <p>
I will be curious to see what percentage of respondents the NRA reports as supporting their position. It should not be 100%, since I pressed “2” just out of spite.

  <title>Ordination Charge for Brian Warfield</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jan 20, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Ordination Charge for Brian Warfield</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 20, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
I was honored to be asked to deliver the following charge to the minister at the ordination of Brian Warfield, one of our best former students. It was a pleasure to see Brian, Misty, and to meet their children. It was also great to catch up with friends at Spring Creek Baptist Church, where Brian was ordained. The text of my remarks follows:
</p>

 <p>
Charge to the Minister <br></br>
Ordination of Brian Warfield <br></br>
April 11, 2012
</p>





 <p>
Brian, I am honored to have this opportunity to participate in your ordination service. I have often wondered where students have ended up, and to what kind of ministry they were led. Facebook has changed that. Now I generally know even more than I wanted. Sometimes, I’m surprised to hear that a former student is now on a church staff, or that someone else is not pastoring somewhere. Sometimes, the proper response is not surprise, but sadness, especially when gifted young ministers feel compelled to leave their own tradition because there is no place there for them to serve. In this case, though, I felt a deep sense of pleasure when I read that one of my best students was being ordained by one of my favorite churches.
</p>

 <p>
You have asked me to deliver the charge to the minister. A charge is a kind of challenge that is laid before you, something for you to keep in mind as you walk this path on which God has led you. So, I now charge you to remember these three things.
</p>

 <p>
First, remember that the questions are quite often more important than the answers. Too many sermons are answers to questions that no one is asking. As such, they are vain, empty, and useless. One of the most common causes of failed ministries occurs when a minister is called to a new church, and begins proclaiming answers before asking enough of the right questions. Answers that come too quickly tend to show a lack of respect for the question, which is taken to be a lack of respect for the questioner.
</p>

 <p>
Jesus understood the importance of questions. When he was asked, “Who is my neighbor?” he replied, after a story, with another question, “Which one of these was the neighbor?” Understanding comes not when we are force-fed answers, but rather when we are equipped to answer our own questions. Before that, though, we need to learn how to ask the right questions. That is one of the most valuable things that a minister can do for a congregation.
</p>

 <p>
Finally, there are some questions for which there are no sufficient answers. Jesus’ cry from the cross is one of those, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” When in the presence of such suffering, the right response is not to provide answers, but, with fear and trembling, recognize that the ground upon which you are standing is holy ground.
</p>

 <p>
The second thing I’d like you to remember is that Kingdom growth is not the same thing as church growth. I remember having a conversation with someone when we were starting NorthHaven, our church in Norman. He asked me a question that I wasn’t quite sure how to answer - “What is your market?” At first, I laughed and replied “Liberals.” The more I think about the question, the more it disturbs me. If we treat the church as a marketplace, we shouldn’t be surprised that people are engaging in comparison shopping. We have failed to make disciples, instead we are making customers. And in the back of my mind, I hear Jesus’ words in the temple: “You shall not make my Father’s house a house of trade.”
</p>

 <p>
The heart of the problem is that we have made church growth the ultimate goal. And when we do so, the church tends to become something that God never intended.  Sometimes I wonder just how much of what we do in church today has anything to do with being the church described in the New Testament. In Acts 2, we get a glimpse of the church as it’s described in the New Testament. Daily activities include taking care of each other, sharing meals, and praising God. Everything, interestingly enough, except for evangelism as we now understand it. Yet, the Scripture says that the Lord daily added to their number.
</p>

 <p>
Church growth is wonderful, but it shouldn’t be the goal. To make it the goal is to run the risk of compromising the Gospel. The easiest way to achieve church growth is by preaching what Bonhoeffer called “cheap grace.”  When tempted, think back to chapter  6 of John’s Gospel. After Jesus proclaimed a difficult teaching, John said that many of his disciples left him. It is a poignant scene when Jesus turned the twelve, and asked “Do you also wish to go away?” Making church growth the criterion of a successful ministry is to adopt a model of ministry that would make Jesus’ ministry on earth a failure.
</p>

 <p>
The goal of church growth is going to church. The goal of kingdom growth is  <i>being</i> the church, a community of love, the place where the kingdom of God has come into the world.
</p>

 <p>
Finally, keep this in mind - remembering where you came from is more important than knowing where you’re going. Although we’re confident in our ultimate destination, none of us knows what intermediate stops we will have along the way.
</p>

 <p>
Why are we here? Why is ordination important? Not so that you can minister. If you had not already shown that you were ministering to those around you, this church would have never considered ordination. We are not a sacramental tradition, so we do not believe that any special grace will flow to you today. So, why do we ordain you? My friend and colleague, Kevin Hall, likes to quote Spurgeon as saying ordination is the laying of empty hands on an empty head. I’ve read some of your academic work, so I’m confident that it is not an empty head that we lay hands on today. Still, though, why is this important?
</p>

 <p>
Paul’s letters to Timothy give us a clue. 1 Timothy is primarily instructional. It’s about taking care of the business of the church. Things are good, let’s get down to work. 2 Timothy, though, has a different tone. After the salutation, Paul writes:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
Recalling your tears, I long to see you so that I may be filled with joy. I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that lived first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, lives in you. For this reason I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands; for God did not give us a spirit of cowardice, but rather a spirit of power and of love and of self- discipline.
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
What events prompted this change of tone? Why does Paul think it necessary to remind Timothy of the faith of his family and of the time of his ordination? I suspect that it’s because Timothy is experiencing one of those times in ministry that we all have. There will come a time when this thought comes to mind. It has happened to me, and I’m sure that it has happened to many others. The thought is this: “The only mistake that God ever made in history is calling me to ministry.” When that thought comes, remember this day.
</p>

 <p>
You need to be ordained for the same reason that Jesus needed to hear the voice of the Father at his baptism, saying “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” The memory of that moment may have been exactly what Jesus needed when it came time to face the trials that lay ahead. Ordination is important for those times that you don’t think that you are up to the task, when you don’t feel that you have the right skills or the right words. When that time comes that you cannot seem to believe in yourself, remember that today, a church, the Body of Christ, believed in you. That my friend, is surely enough.
</p>

 <p>
Amen
</p>

  <title>Penn Jillette on Science and Religion</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jan 19, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Penn Jillette on Science and Religion</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 19, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
 <a href="https://www.daringfireball.net">John Gruber</a> recently posted this interesting quote from Penn Jillette, of Penn and Teller fame:
</p>


 <blockquote>
 <p>
There is no god and that’s the simple truth. If every trace of any single religion died out and nothing were passed on, it would never be created exactly that way again. There might be some other nonsense in its place, but not that exact nonsense. If all of science were wiped out, it would still be true and someone would find a way to figure it all out again.
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p class="source">
Penn Jillette <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup></p>


 <p>
There is a lot to think about here. Keep in mind that I haven’t read the book, but have only seen this single paragraph. Here are my initial thoughts in no particular order.
</p>

 <p>
The argument seems to be this: imagine that a body of belief were somehow completely eradicated from human minds. If humans were somehow to replicate this body of belief, then such replication would be evidence in favor of its truth. Failure to replicate the body of belief would be evidence in favor of its falsity.
</p>

 <p>
Now, as I often say in class, it’s a bit more complicated than this. First, science itself is not a body of belief. It is instead a method of producing beliefs. So, the proposal must be not to “wipe out science” but instead to eradicate all belief in and memory of all propositions that we consider part of science, that is, claims in physics, biology, chemistry, etc. Then, we should ask if these beliefs would eventually be replicated.
</p>

 <p>
I assume that Jillette requires only that current scientific beliefs be replicated. There’s no reason why he should require Galen’s ideas about physiology and anatomy or Aristotle’s physics to be replicated, since they are false. Why believe that current scientific beliefs would be replicated? I guess because Jillette assumes that they are true. Now, only the most radical antirealist would assume that nothing in current science is true, so I’ll grant that we have good reason for believing that at least much of current science is in fact true. How much of current scientific belief is true, though? Surely not all of it. As Newtonian mechanics was eventually replaced with relativity theory and quantum mechanics, might there at some point be another theoretical framework that replaces current physics? There’s no reason to think that everything science asserts now is true, so there’s no reason to think that it would be exactly replicated. So, what is true of religion is also true of science - “There might be some other nonsense in its place, but not that exact nonsense.”
</p>

 <p>
So, if we won’t demand exact replication in science, then we shouldn’t demand exact replication for religion either. Does that mean that those religious beliefs that would be replicated then should be considered true? I don’t find it difficult to believe that the belief that a god exists would find its way back into the human psyche, along with other beliefs about the god’s role in causing the universe to be, the demands that the god makes on humans, etc.
</p>

 <p>
I suppose that the reply would be that these are individual religious beliefs, what must be replicated is a system of religious belief, and that there’s no reason to believe that any current system of religious thought would be replicated. Surely though, there are bodies of religious belief that could easily be replicated. Some minimal deism, for instance, is very likely to be replicated.
</p>

 <p>
There is reason why one would think that, if scientific knowledge were somehow eradicated, that we would come to discover those scientific truths again. That is because we think that the method of science is truth-conducive. That is, the scientific method, in the long run, will produce true beliefs and eliminate false beliefs. This is something famously argued by the American pragmatist Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914). <sup> <a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> Now, that doesn’t mean that every use of the scientific method produces true belief or eliminates false beliefs. Some people may just not be very good scientists. In other cases, the particular scientists may be very good, but simply have some false background assumptions. <sup> <a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup> The particular beliefs that are true, though, would be replicated if science is truth-conducive. So, would religious beliefs be eventually replicated if they were eradicated? That depends on the means by which such beliefs were produced. If religious beliefs are formed by a truth-conducive method, then there is every reason that they would be. What could be the method that produced my religious beliefs? One possibility is that God gave them to me, and surely that’s a truth-conducive method. 
</p>

 <p>
So, in the end, Jillette’s argument begs the question. That is, he hasn’t given us a successful argument that religious belief is false because religious belief would not be replicated. Instead, if he argues successfully for anything, it is that religious belief would not be replicated if all religious belief is false. I grant that the conditional is true, but I haven’t been shown any reason why I should grant that all religious belief is false. If one paragraph was this thought-provoking, I’m looking forward to reading the rest of the book.

  <title>Permanent Impermanence</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jan 19, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Permanent Impermanence</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 19, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <blockquote>
 <p>
As I wrote recently, everything in existence is permanently impermanent. 
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p class="source">
 <a href="http://minimalmac.com/post/14973202531/the-only-standard-is-impermanence%20Minimal%20Mac" class="source">Patrick Rhone</a>
</p>

 <p>
I detect shades of Heraclitus here.
</p>

 <p>
Question: is this a paradox? Answer: probably not, unless Rhone is committed to the belief that nothing at all, even impermanence, is permanent. It is a good opportunity to do some analytic philosophy, though. 
</p>

 <p>
What is permanence? Is it a real property, or is it a derivative analyzed in terms of the real properties of an object? What’s the status of self-predication; must permanence itself be permanent? If there is nothing in existence that is permanent, then does that mean that abstract objects (numbers, sets, etc.) do not exist? Does that commit us to something like subsistence for abstract entities? Does permanence mean simply that an object always exists, or does it also mean that an object never changes? If the first, then most, if not all, theists would reject the claim that nothing in existence is permanent. If the second, then we would have to at least reject the doctrine of the immutability of God.
</p>

 <p>
Here’s my first attempt to symbolize permanence, attempting to say that that an object is permanent just in case for any property that the object has any time, it has that property at all times.
</p>



 <p>
\[ \forall x \{\textrm{Px} \leftrightarrow [\forall \textrm{F} \forall t_{1} (\textrm{F}xt_{1} \rightarrow \forall t_{2} \textrm{F}xt_{2})]\} \]
</p>


 <p>
This is why people hate analytic philosophers.

  <title>Praying for Enemies</title>

  <summary>Jan 20, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Praying for Enemies</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 20, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Mitch Randall’s sermon this Sunday was on loving one’s enemies, a notion that I believe is the radically distinctive concept in the ethics of Jesus. This week’s prayer:
</p>

 <p>
In this deeply divided world, <br></br>
the best we hope for is <br></br>
tolerance, <br></br>
absence of conflict, <br></br>
live and let live. <br></br></p>

 <p>
The path that we have taken <br></br>
is not the way of Jesus, <br></br>
who said, <br></br>
“Love your enemies and <br></br>
pray for those who persecute you.”
</p>

 <p>
It’s not that I don’t pray, Lord.
</p>

 <p>
I pray <br></br>
that they would get what’s coming to them, <br></br>
that they would see things my way, <br></br>
that they would realize how wrong they are.
</p>

 <p>
Teach me, Lord, <br></br>
the difference between <br></br>
“praying for” <br></br>
and merely “praying that….”
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

  <title>Relativism and the Rights of Women in Afghanistan</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jan 20, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Relativism and the Rights of Women in Afghanistan</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 20, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <section id="outline-container-orgc3ca973" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="orgc3ca973">Cultural Relativism</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc3ca973">
 <p>
For many of those that hold the position, cultural relativism is motivated by a belief that we should be tolerant of the moral beliefs of other cultures. Most of the time, this is expressed in a way that is simply inconsistent, that is, given that there are no objective, universal moral truths, we  <i>ought</i> to be tolerant of the moral beliefs of other cultures. Unfortunately, one cannot consistently assert both that there are no objective, universal, moral truths and that we have a moral obligation to be tolerant, especially since our culture is often intolerant.
</p>
</div>
</section> <section id="outline-container-org7427a06" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="org7427a06">Options for the Relativist</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7427a06">
 <p>
Even though relativists often are inconsistent, they need not be. Here are some ways that that one could try to assert a consistent relativism:
</p>

 <ol class="org-ol"> <li>When the relativist asserts that we ought to be tolerant, the assertion should not be understood as a moral claim. Instead, it should be understood as a pragmatic claim. That is, we ought to be tolerant, not because we are morally obligated to, but because it is in our best interests as a way of minimizing conflict.</li>
 <li>We shouldn’t adopt relativism because we have a moral duty to be tolerant, of course that is inconsistent. Rather, once our culture comes to realize the truth of cultural relativism, we would naturally come to adopt an ethic of tolerance. Then, it would be true that we ought to be tolerant, since it would be part of our moral code.</li>
 <li>When the relativist claims that we ought to be tolerant, she means simply that tolerance is a good. There is no need to understand this as a claim that tolerance is a -moral- good. A good is simply something that is worth pursuing, and there are several reasons why tolerance would be something worth pursuing.</li>
</ol></div>
</section> <section id="outline-container-org978e848" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="org978e848">Tolerance Only to a Point?</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org978e848">
 <p>
I have argued elsewhere that tolerance is not as good as one might think, since it implies an attitude of superiority toward the one being tolerated. Even so, I think it is psychologically impossible for relativists to adopt an attitude of genuine tolerance toward the moral beliefs of cultures that are radically different from our own.
</p>

 <p>
For example, an Afghan woman reported that she was raped by her cousin’s husband two years ago, and she was subsequently sentenced to twelve years in prison ( <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/01/world/asia/afghanistan-rape-victim/index.html)">see CNN’s coverage</a>. At first, it was reported that she would be released if she were to agree to marry her attacker, but authorities later said that the marriage was not a condition for her release. Even so, the imprisonment of a rape victim, who was then forced to care for her child in prison, is an unconscionable action according to most cultural relativists. That is, there are cultural beliefs and practices that should be changed, not simply tolerated.
</p>

 <p>
So, what moral beliefs should be tolerated? I suspect that the level of tolerance would be highly correlated with the degree of similarity to our own moral beliefs and practices. That is, the relativist would maintain that we ought to tolerate the beliefs and practices of other cultures so long as they are not too different from our own.
</p>

 <p>
That, however, is neither tolerance nor relativism. Instead, it is simply a thinly disguised moral realism.

  <title>Who Is My Enemy?</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jan 20, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Who Is My Enemy?</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 20, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
The parable of the Good Samaritan is prompted by a lawyer’s question in Luke 10:29, “But wanting to justify himself, he asked Jesus, ‘And who is my neighbor?’”   That phrase, “But wanting to justify himself” plays an important role in a sermon of mine, where I claimed that this places the lawyer on par with the typical caller on a talk-radio show. On this reading, the phrase means something like, “In order to impress those listening in,” or “In order to sound smarter than he really was.” 
</p>

 <p>
I’m no longer confident, though, that I’ve been fair to the lawyer. Why would any 1st-century Jew have asked what the greatest commandment was? Everyone would have agreed that it is found in Deuteronomy 6:5, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.” 
</p>

 <p>
And given the themes in the prophets and the law, Jesus’ claim that the second greatest commandment was the requirement to love one’s neighbor as oneself  in Leviticus 19:18 would also strike listeners as obvious. 
</p>

 <p>
So, the lawyer, having just asked a question to which everyone listening would have though the answer was obvious, then proceeded to ask another question with an even more obvious answer, “Who is my neighbor?”  Maybe the lawyer suspected that God’s commandment was more radical than we ever assumed. 
</p>

 <p>
Maybe the lawyer was present four chapters earlier, when Jesus uttered these words, “But I say to you that listen, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you.”
</p>

 <p>
I’ve been thinking about this for the past few days after hearing Mitch Randall’s sermon at  <a href="http://northhavenchurch.net">NorthHaven Church</a> on loving our enemies. What would Jesus have said if the same lawyer were to have asked, “Who is my enemy?”
</p>

 <p>
Sixteen months in a combat zone taught me that identifying enemies can be difficult. It is not in the enemy’s best interests to be identifiable as an enemy. It may also be that I am the one who is antagonistic, but self-deceptive about the extent and nature of my antagonism. Even if I have them, it may be difficult for me to see myself as a person who makes enemies.
</p>

 <p>
So, how do I begin to understand who my enemy is? Maybe I should begin by answering these questions:
</p>

 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>In whose failure would I take pleasure?</li>
 <li>At whose expense do I direct my humor?</li>
 <li>To whom do I need to feel superior?</li>
</ul> <p>
Sometimes we feel like we are surrounded by enemies. I fear that they are enemies that we have constructed for our own sake. 
</p>

 <p>
Lord have mercy.

</header> <p>
Jesus,
</p>

 <p>
You found a man living in a cemetery, <br></br>
bound by chains that he did not forge, <br></br>
forced on him by people who were afraid.
</p>

 <p>
I, too, am bound in chains, <br></br>
some forged by ignorance, <br></br>
every link a failure to recognize <br></br>
your image in another human.
</p>

 <p>
Others forged by arrogance, <br></br>
of thinking that there are those <br></br>
not fit for your kingdom, <br></br>
or for your service.
</p>

 <p>
Still others forged by fear, <br></br>
the fear of rejection, <br></br>
the fear of difference.
</p>

 <p>
You who created the world <br></br>
in all of its diversity <br></br>
and declared it to be good,
</p>

 <p>
Free me from the arrogant presumption <br></br>
of thinking that I would have done better.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>Prayer for a Life that Affirms</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Feb 11, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Prayer for a Life that Affirms</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Feb 11, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Casie Trotter sent me a link to a wonderful passage from Nietzsche’s 1882 book,  <i>The Gay Science</i>. This is aphorism 276, his resolution for that year:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
I want to learn more and more how to see what is necessary in things as what is beautiful in them — thus I will be one of those who make things beautiful… I do not want to wage war against ugliness. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse the accusers… And all in all and on the whole: some day I want only to be a Yes-sayer!
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
I’m not sure what Nietzsche would think of his work prompting this week’s prayer, but here it is anyway:
</p>

 <p>
God of beauty and wonder,
</p>

 <p>
Let me be known <br></br>
not for what I found ugly, <br></br>
but for what I found beautiful.
</p>

 <p>
Not for what was harmed, <br></br>
but for what was healed.
</p>

 <p>
Not for what I tore down, <br></br>
but for what I built up.
</p>

 <p>
Not for what I despised, <br></br>
but for all that I loved.
</p>

 <p>
In the name of the one <br></br>
who sees the beauty in us all,
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

  <title>Transfiguration Sunday Prayer</title>

  <summary>Feb 15, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Transfiguration Sunday Prayer</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Feb 15, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Father,
</p>

 <p>
In the blindness of our arrogance, <br></br>
we think that we are free, <br></br>
yet, so often, we are in chains, <br></br>
slaves to the satisfaction of our own desires, <br></br>
and to the pursuit of our own selfish ends. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Our prayer today is that <br></br>
we may be transformed, <br></br>
freed, so that we may <br></br>
live as Christ lived, <br></br>
and love as he loved, <br></br>
every moment of our lives <br></br>
an act of restoration and redemption, <br></br>
and our faith a witness to <br></br>
coming of the Kingdom of God, <br></br>
when the justice of the Father <br></br>
and the love of the Son, <br></br>
rule together with the power of the Spirit. <br></br>
in perfect fullness and harmony.
</p>

 <p>
Let these gifts today be <br></br>
the first acts of our new lives. <br></br></p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

Lord, have mercy, <br></br>
for I have heard the gentle voice of God, <br></br>
yet speak to others with words that hurt and destroy.
</p>

 <p>
Lord, have mercy, <br></br>
for I have been given more than I could ever use, <br></br>
yet refuse to see the needs of those around me.
</p>

 <p>
Lord, have mercy, <br></br>
for you have placed me in positions of power and influence, <br></br>
yet I use those positions for my own gain, and not in service to your children.
</p>

 <p>
Lord, have mercy, <br></br>
for you have placed me as your steward on this earth, <br></br>
yet I continue to harm your creation by the choices that I make.
</p>

 <p>
Lord, have mercy, <br></br>
for every breath I take is a gift from you, <br></br>
yet I focus only on the few meaningless things that I lack.
</p>

 <p>
Lord, have mercy, <br></br>
for I have experienced the power of the Resurrection, <br></br>
yet my thoughts are often as one who has no hope.
</p>

 <p>
Lord, have mercy, <br></br>
for I have have been set free by the Cross, <br></br>
yet live as one who is still in bondage.
</p>

 <p>
Lord, have mercy on me, a sinner. <br></br></p>

 <p>
We who are your children, <br></br>
in humility and penitence, <br></br>
now seek your face.
</p>

 <p>
Lord, have mercy.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
Much more surely then, now that we have been justified by his blood, will we be saved through him from the wrath of God. For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more surely, having been reconciled, will we be saved by his life. But more than that, we even boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.

  <title>The Cross Shattered Christ, Chapter 1</title>

Reflections on  <i>Cross-Shattered Christ: Meditations on the Seven Last Words</i> by Stanley Hauerwas, Chapter 1.
</p>



 <p>
This chapter is perfect reading for the week following Ash Wednesday. The traditional liturgical declaration uttered by the minister “Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return” is a reminder of our mortality. Ash Wednesday is quickly forgotten, though, just as the somber reflection that occurs after a funeral quickly fades as life returns to normal. As Hauerwas points out, this death, the death of the Son of God, is like no other. To truly come terms with the death of Jesus is to understand that life can never return to normal. Jesus’ plea from the cross, “Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing,” challenges our understanding both of God and of ourselves. In Hauerwas’ words, “We are made members of a kingdom governed by a politics of forgiveness and redemption. The world is offered an alternative unimaginable by our sin-determined fantasies.” <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> We are offered a glimpse of this kingdom in the lives of a few who are able to live in the shadow of the cross. May we find the strength to dwell there during this season of Lent.

Lord Jesus, <br></br></p>

 <p>
As I find myself <br></br>
grasping for more, <br></br>
even though I <br></br>
surely have enough,
</p>

 <p>
I hear the voice <br></br>
of the Spirit whisper, <br></br>
“Is this how you <br></br>
follow the one <br></br>
who had no place <br></br>
to lay his head, <br></br>
whose only robe <br></br>
was taken from him <br></br>
and gambled away?”

 <p>
May I never confuse <br></br>
the abundant life <br></br>
with an empty <br></br>
life of abundance.

  <title>The Cross-Shattered Christ, Chapter 2</title>

  <summary>Mar 07, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">The Cross-Shattered Christ, Chapter 2</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Mar 07, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
I struggled with the second chapter of Hauerwas’ book,  <i>The Cross-Shattered Christ</i> <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>, not because the chapter was particularly hard to follow, but because it forced me to reflect on my life as a teacher and minister. The chapter opened with a discussion of the reticence of the Gospels, why do they not tell us everything that we want to know? Why is Jesus simply silent on what many of us think are the most important questions of the day? We tend to be uncomfortable during times of silence, so we attempt to fill in the gaps, even when we have little of value to say. In much the same way, we are often uncomfortable with uncertainty, that is, being faced with questions for which we have no clear answers, so we take on the role of spokespeople for Christ. 
</p>

 <p>
Hauerwas points out the presumptuousness of this: “Our attempt to speak confidently of God in the face of modern skepticism, a skepticism we suspect also grips our lives as Christians, betrays a certainty inappropriate for a people who worship a crucified God.”
</p>

 <p>
One thing that I love about my job is the significant conversations that I have with colleagues and students. At lunch yesterday, I felt the discomfort of having no answer when asked about how to respond to particularly difficult questions asked by sincere followers of other religions.
</p>

 <p>
It’s not that I have nothing to say, it’s rather that what I have to say seems insufficient for the task at hand. All of my clear and concise explanations suddenly seem incomplete and inadequate in the shadow the Cross of the Crucified One.

We profess to be strangers and pilgrims, seeking after a country of our own, yet we settle down in the most un-stranger-like fashion, exactly as if we were quite at home and meant to stay as long as we could. I don’t wonder apostolic miracles have died. Apostolic living certainly has.

 <b>A prayer for reconciliation.</b>
</p>

 <p>
God of love,
</p>

 <p>
We open our arms <br></br>
to hug and to hold, <br></br>
welcome and invite.
</p>

 <p>
With outstretched hands, <br></br>
we lower our defenses <br></br>
and accept the vulnerability <br></br>
that comes with love.
</p>

 <p>
Did the soldiers know <br></br>
what they were doing <br></br>
as they stretched the arms <br></br>
of Jesus onto the cross?
</p>

 <p>
Humiliated and scorned, <br></br>
the Eternal King <br></br>
chose vulnerability, love, <br></br>
and reconciliation <br></br>
instead of rejection.
</p>

 <p>
Give us the courage <br></br>
to do the same.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>The Cross-Shattered Christ, Chapter 3</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">The Cross-Shattered Christ, Chapter 3</h1>

</header> <p>
Kierkegaard’s  <i>Fear and Trembling</i> focuses on Abraham, an example of what Kierkegaard calls a “Knight of Faith.” When I asked for other examples, someone suggested Mary, the mother of Jesus. At the time, I was skeptical, because it did not seem to me that Mary had an opportunity to reject God’s plan; the angel Mary announced that Mary would conceive, and never asked Mary if she wanted to cooperate in this endeavor.
</p>

 <p>
My mistake, as if often the case, is to think of Mary only as the young girl in the Christmas story, and neglect the woman that reared a child whom she surely could never keep — anguish foreshadowed by Simeon’s remark by Simeon’s cryptic remark to Mary, “A sword will pierce your own soul too.” Mary, though, despite her anguish, has hope, as we must also. As Hauerwas states:
</p>

 <p>
So may we never forget that we, the church, comprise Mary’s home. A home, moreover, that promises not safety but rather the ongoing challenge of being a people called from the nations to be God’s people. A people constituted by faith in the One who refused to triumph through the violence the world believes to be the only means possible to achieve some limited good, to insure we will be remembered. The refusal to use violence in the name of the good does not mean this people can forget those singled out in Mary’s song of triumph— that is, the poor and powerless. Rather, it means that such a people, Mary-like, must live by hope— a hope that patiently waits with Mary at the foot of her son’s cross. <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup></p>

The best sermons open our eyes to present realities, give us hope for a future in the Kingdom, and challenge us to move forward into that future. Yesterday’s sermon by Mitch Randall​ at NorthHaven Church​ was certainly one of those. Here is the prayer for the week:
</p>

 <p>
God of Justice,
</p>

 <p>
In 1961, <br></br>
the Freedom Riders <br></br>
were beaten with pipes <br></br>
after their bus was bombed <br></br>
in a terrorist act.
</p>

 <p>
I, Lord, would never <br></br>
have swung a pipe in anger.
</p>

 <p>
Fifty-four years later, <br></br>
those on another bus <br></br>
shout ugly chants to <br></br>
reinforce a false <br></br>
sense of superiority.
</p>

 <p>
I, Lord, would have refused <br></br>
to utter the reprehensible words.
</p>

 <p>
Instead, Lord, <br></br>
I am the one <br></br>
who stands in silence, <br></br>
and does nothing, <br></br>
but enables everything.
</p>

 <p>
Lord have mercy <br></br>
on my <br></br>
apathetic, <br></br>
indifferent, <br></br>
lukewarm <br></br>
soul.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

So far, this has been the most challenging and difficult chapter for me. Hauerwas challenges us reflect on our standard interpretations of Jesus’ cry of despair from the cross, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” and understand it not in terms of one who is sacrificed to satisfy a vengeful God, but as a cry from the God who both sacrifices and is sacrificed. That we find this cry of Jesus so difficult to comprehend shows that we, as citizens of this world, understand and identify with the power and authority of the empire. Instead, “Jesus refuses to accept the terms of how the world understands power and authority…. We are the spared because God refuses to have us lost.” <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup></p>

 <p>
God refuses to play by our rules. Thanks be to God.

It is telling that the cry from the cross, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” is followed by the simple declaration, “I thirst.” We thirst for God, not because God has forsaken us, nor because we have forsaken God. We simply thirst for God — we thirst for God’s mercy, we thirst for God’s justice in this world, we thirst to be loved by God’s people as God loves us. Relief from that thirst is “…found in the body and blood of our Lord that forever slakes our thirst. So refreshed, we become for the world the reminder that God has not abandoned us….” <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup></p>

With praise and palm branches, <br></br>
the people celebrated <br></br>
their new freedom <br></br>
from their Greek overlords.
</p>

 <p>
And in a new century, <br></br>
and under a new empire, <br></br>
the people once again <br></br>
wave the palm branches <br></br>
and cheer for a new hero.
</p>

 <p>
Jesus rode into Jerusalem <br></br>
and the people cheered, <br></br>
but Jesus wept, <br></br>
for they could not see <br></br>
that the Jesus for whom we cheer <br></br>
is not the same Jesus <br></br>
that we behold upon the cross <br></br>
in silence, and in awe.
</p>

 <p>
Father, forgive us <br></br>
for seeing only <br></br>
the messiah that we want, <br></br>
and not the messiah that we need.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

Tiny gold crosses <br></br>

gold chains, <br></br>
signs of <br></br>
wealth, affluence, <br></br>
and good taste, <br></br>
compared to <br></br>

covered in blood, <br></br>
an instrument of torture, <br></br>
a symbol designed <br></br>
to bring terror <br></br>
to enemies of the state.
</p>

 <p>
On this day, Lord, <br></br>
give me a vision <br></br>
of the horror of the cross, <br></br>
for without it <br></br>
there is no beauty <br></br>
of the cross.

Prayer for a rainy Easter Day:
</p>

 <p>
The refreshing rain <br></br>
falls upon the parched land <br></br>
And brings life to the <br></br>
cracked, barren earth.
</p>

Believing in the resurrection does not just mean assenting to a dogma and noting a historical fact. It means participating in this creative act of God. Resurrection is not a consoling opium, soothing us with the promise of a better world in the hereafter. It is the energy for a rebirth of this life. The hope doesn’t point to another world. It is focused on the redemption of this one.

  <title>Dostoevsky, Suffering, and the Prayer for the Week</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Apr 15, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Dostoevsky, Suffering, and the Prayer for the Week</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Apr 15, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
This past weekend  was a weekend of funerals — two very different people, both with lives that had been cut tragically short. Then, on Tuesday, I learned of two more tragedies involving families in the Army units that I serve. Coincidentally, all of this happens as one of my classes is studying one of the central works on the problem of suffering, the chapter titled in “Rebellion” in Dostoevsky’s masterpiece,  <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>. <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> In the novel, Ivan argued that moral decency and the love of humanity demand that we should refuse to live in what he thought to be a clearly unjust world. The only decent thing to do would be to, in his words, “return one’s ticket.”
</p>

 <p>
Ivan makes two related mistakes here. First, he believes that he can judge the world from an objective position. This, though, ignores the fact that we are embedded and entangled, part of the world that we presume to judge. The second mistake is assuming that the world that we now experience is morally static, that is, assuming that the suffering of the innocent has always, and will always, occur, and if God created this world, he created it to be an unjust world.
</p>

 <p>
As I said, these mistakes are related. I am not an innocent, objective judge. The level of justice or injustice in the world is, in an important way, partly a function of my action or inaction. The world that we experience, then, is one of our own creation; not one that we have created ex nihilo, but rather through our perversion of God’s good creation. God, though, can redeem even that which we have corrupted. So, instead of maintaining, like Ivan, that we cannot accept this world of God’s, we should instead strive, by God’s grace, to make his world into that which he always planned for it to be, and promised that it would in fact someday be. We do this, not by loving humanity, but by loving our neighbors, wherever and whoever they may be.
</p>

 <p>
Father,
</p>

 <p>
Grant us the faith to be <br></br>
your redeemed people, <br></br>
who announce to the world <br></br>
by word and deed <br></br>
the miracle of your <br></br>
reconciling love.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>Prayer for Silence</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Apr 27, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Prayer for Silence</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Apr 27, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Holy God,
</p>

 <p>
There are times when <br></br>
we just have no words, <br></br>
times of great beauty, <br></br>
or times of great suffering.
</p>

 <p>
But our silence <br></br>
makes us uncomfortable, <br></br>
and we feel that <br></br>
we must say something, <br></br>
so we fill the silence <br></br>
with meaningless noise <br></br>
and empty chatter.
</p>

 <p>
So, when we feel the urge <br></br>
to trivialize the sublime <br></br>
with our vain babbling, <br></br>
give us the strength <br></br>
to cover our mouths <br></br>
and stand before <br></br>
your holiness <br></br>
in silence <br></br>
and in awe.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

  <title>Prayer for Justice</title>

  <summary>Apr 29, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Prayer for Justice</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Apr 29, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
A cry for justice swells up <br></br>
from a people who have seen <br></br>
so little of it.
</p>

 <p>
“Yes, justice,” <br></br>
comes the reply, <br></br>
“But first, <br></br>
we must have peace. <br></br>
Peace today, <br></br>
maybe justice tomorrow.”
</p>

 <p>
But a peace without justice, <br></br>
is not the Shalom of God. <br></br>
It is a peace that serves <br></br>
the status quo, <br></br>
the interests of the powerful, <br></br>
and the coffers of the wealthy.
</p>

 <p>
The prophets tell us that <br></br>
your justice is measured <br></br>
not by its effect <br></br>
on the privileged, <br></br>
but by its effect <br></br>
on those who have <br></br>
been denied <br></br>
privilege and power.
</p>

 <p>
The day is coming when <br></br>
God’s justice will reign, <br></br>
when the low are lifted up <br></br>
and the mighty fall, <br></br>
and woe unto us <br></br>
who have stood in the way <br></br>
because of our silence.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

  <title>Unexpected Grace</title>

  <summary>May 08, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Unexpected Grace</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">May 08, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
This week’s prayer is simple, but informed by events of the week that profoundly impacted me. First, NorthHaven Church​ was in the area that sustained some wind damage in Wednesday night’s storm. The next day, Imam Imad Enchassi​ of the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City graciously asked if we needed any help. To all our Muslim friends,  <i>As-Salaam-Alaikum</i>.
</p>

 <p>
Second, I see in my students a level of spiritual depth that I certainly did not have in my 20’s and may not yet have in my 50’s — one that moves beyond the superficial trivialities that pass for spirituality in much of American religion, but instead shows a deep understanding of the message of Jesus.
</p>

 <p>
Gracious and Loving God,
</p>

 <p>
Thank you for those moments <br></br>
when grace breaks in <br></br>
to interrupt our lives <br></br>
in surprising ways, <br></br>
and unexpected voices <br></br>
teach us once again <br></br>
what it means <br></br>
to follow Jesus.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>Prayer for Mothers Day</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>May 10, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Prayer for Mothers Day</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">May 10, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Mother’s Day can be an awkward time in the life of the church. There is a great deal of internal pressure to commemorate the day, but we should acknowledge that there are many who are understandably uncomfortable on this day. There are those who may have painful memories of abuse at the hand of their biological mothers, others who may have never known their mothers, and many others who have never had, nor will ever have, children of their own. So, in this week’s prayer, I’ve tried to celebrate, not motherhood per se, but the nature of caregivers, whoever they may be.
</p>

 <p>
Loving God,
</p>

 <p>
We give thanks this day, <br></br>
for those who care <br></br>
for children, <br></br>
for aging parents, <br></br>
and for neighbors, <br></br>
for anyone who needs <br></br>
a warm smile, <br></br>
a cheerful greeting, <br></br>
or a kind word.
</p>


 <p>
And we are blessed <br></br>
by those who <br></br>
love every child <br></br>
as one of their own, <br></br>
for reflected <br></br>
in their eyes, <br></br>
we see the face <br></br>
of Jesus.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

Thanks to AJ Lopez for sharing this quote with me.
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
Instead of telling our vulnerable stories, we seek safety in abstractions, speaking to each other about our opinions, ideas and beliefs rather than about our lives. Academic culture blesses this practice by insisting that the more abstract our speech, the more likely we are to touch the universal truths that unite us. But what happens is exactly the reverse: as our discourse becomes more abstract, the less connected we feel. There is less sense community among intellectuals than in the most “primitive” society of storytellers.

  <title>Prayer for an Isolated People</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>May 14, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Prayer for an Isolated People</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">May 14, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
God of Grace and Wholeness, <br></br></p>

 <p>
All around us, we see pain and heartache, <br></br>
the effects of fragmented and broken systems, <br></br>
communities, and families. <br></br>
When the pain of others becomes <br></br>
too much for us to bear, <br></br>
we respond by building up walls <br></br>
that separate us from the world.
</p>

 <p>
So here we stay, <br></br>
safe and secure <br></br>
behind our walls of division, <br></br>
seeing only ourselves, <br></br>
our own problems, <br></br>
and our own hopes.
</p>

 <p>
We boast of our love for humanity, <br></br>
while at the same time, <br></br>
fail to see the needs of our neighbor.
</p>

 <p>
But God, You have called us to be your people, <br></br>
and you have have given us a new commandment, <br></br>
the commandment to love one another. <br></br>
Loving others, though, is something that we cannot do <br></br>
from a position of safety and security, <br></br>
for to love is embrace vulnerability and risk, <br></br>
all for the sake of the beloved. <br></br></p>

 <p>
So, guide our hands to reach out across our walls <br></br>
and open our eyes to see beyond ourselves, <br></br>
so that we might be used by you <br></br>
for the healing of this world. <br></br> <br></br>
In the name of Jesus Christ, <br></br>
who called us to be in the world, <br></br>
but not of it, <br></br>
we pray. <br></br></p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

This blog is hosted on Github, and posting from iOS has been a challenge. I’m optimistic that things have become much easier with the release of  <a href="http://workingcopyapp.com">Working Copy</a>, which is a Git client for iOS that can fetch, merge, and push to both Github and Bitbucket.
 I cloned my site repository to the iPad with Working Copy, created a new Markdown file, and opened the file in  <a href="http://bywordapp.com">Byword</a> with the iOS document picker. 
</p>

 <p>
In a moment, I will try to push the new file to the repository, and hope that a new post shortly appears.
</p>

 <p>
UPDATE: Success! I like writing with  <a href="http://omz-software.com/editorial/">Editorial</a>, but it can’t use the document picker. There is an Editorial workflow for Working Copy, but I haven’t tried it yet. Byword is working perfectly.

  <title>In Praise of an Unsafe Education</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>May 21, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">In Praise of an Unsafe Education</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">May 21, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
I was excited to see an excerpt from Neil Gaiman’s new book recently in  <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2014/10/23/neil-gaiman-trigger-warning-cover-excerpt/17719799/%20"> <i>USA Today</i></a>, explaining why he chose “Trigger Warning” as the title. It didn’t strike me that the title could be controversial until I saw this  <a href="https://twitter.com/skinnygrlsfloat/status/561365292693999617">tweet</a> asking why he chose such a “thoughtless and insensitive title.”
  It’s no surprise that such accusations prompted a rather thoughtful and sensitive response from Gaiman, one of my favorite authors.
</p>
 <section id="outline-container-org7cc059a" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="org7cc059a">Trigger Warnings</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7cc059a">
 <p>
A trigger warning is a statement that a film or work of literature portrays  scenes that some may find disturbing, especially for those who have experienced similar events themselves. Like Gaiman, I have conflicted feelings about trigger warnings.
</p>

 <p>
On one hand, we ought to be sensitive to the emotional needs of others. Several years ago, I was at a conference with an Army colleague who had lost friends in the Korangal Valley of Afghanistan. When the speaker began showing clips from the documentary  <i>Restrepo</i>, I watched my colleague appear increasingly uncomfortable.  From her reaction, I don’t think she was prepared to relive those experiences, especially in public.
</p>

 <p>
On the other hand, it seems that many of the trigger warnings used today in higher education, or at least Christian higher education, are not used to protect those who have had disturbing experiences in the past. Instead, they are used to protect innocent minds from having particular kinds of experiences at all, like hearing vulgar speech or seeing a nude body. Such trigger warnings are concessions to those who want education to be safe, and students to be protected from the vulgar, profane, and offensive.
</p>
</div>
</section> <section id="outline-container-orge579068" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="orge579068">Safe Christian Education?</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge579068">
 <p>
The world, though, is often vulgar, profane, and offensive, and to portray it otherwise is a lie. It is impossible for students to receive a Christian education and never encounter the world as it, for a Christian education in which students never encounter accounts of violence, drunkenness, and rape would be a Christian education in which students never read Genesis — that is, it would not be a Christian education at all.
</p>

 <p>
Trigger warnings serve two purposes. First, they give students the opportunity to opt out of engaging the material. Second, they give students the opportunity to mentally and emotionally prepare themselves for the disturbing material that lay ahead. To do the former is to opt out of an education, but what could be wrong with the latter?
</p>

 <p>
There are some events to which the only appropriate emotional responses are shock and horror. To portray these events in ways that do not elicit shock and horror is to do so in a way that ensures that students fail to have the appropriate moral responses. So, in an effort to avoid emotional harm to students, we have caused moral harm instead. Our goal in Christian education should not be to sanitize the world, but to encounter it as it is in the context of a community of love and grace.
</p>

 <p>
As God’s creation, the world is filled with examples of beauty and grace, but in its present fallen state, it is also filled with examples of cruelty and horror. To portray only the horror is to leave students in cynicism and despair; to portray only the beauty is to leave students in gullible idealism and naiveté. Neither genuinely prepares students to deliver the gospel of Christ to a beautiful, yet broken, world.

Holy God,
</p>

 <p>
We give thanks today, <br></br>
not for those who died,
</p>

 <p>
but for those who lived <br></br>
in such a way that they <br></br>
witnessed to a commitment <br></br>
to something worth <br></br>
sacrificing for,
</p>

 <p>
something greater than <br></br>
even their own lives.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

The first week of a break from classes is always a good time for a massive reconfiguration of something tech-related. Last time it was the blog, this time it is Emacs. Since I primarily use Emacs only for LaTeX and Markdown editing, I though I would give Kieran Healy’s  <a href="https://kieranhealy.org/resources/emacs-starter-kit/">Emacs Starter Kit for the Social Sciences</a> a try. He has done a masterful job of setting up a great LaTeX editing machine. Easy to install, and easy to customize.

Triune God,
</p>

 <p>
In those times <br></br>
that we feel alone, <br></br>
lost in the crowd, <br></br>
and disconnected <br></br>
from those around us, <br></br>
we take comfort in knowing <br></br>
that at the center of reality <br></br>
is an unending community of love, <br></br>
and that we, your children, <br></br>
have been invited into <br></br>
the eternal fellowship <br></br>
that is the <br></br>
Father, <br></br>
Son, <br></br>
and Holy Spirit, <br></br>
three persons, <br></br>
but one God, <br></br>
forever and ever.
</p>

 <p>
Amen

  <title>Back to Emacs Prelude</title>

</header> <p>
As I said a few days ago, I switch my Emacs config files to Kieran Healy’s Starter Kit. I really liked the use of Org-mode for the config, and especially the LaTeX and RefTeX configuration. I still like Batsov’s Prelude, though, and there were certainly some things that I missed greatly.
</p>

 <p>
This afternoon, I found Mike McFarland’s  <a href="http://thrownforaloop.com/posts/emacs-configuration/">Emacs configuration</a> online. He uses Prelude with a personal configuration in Org-mode. I have switched back, and brought in much of Kieran’s LaTeX configuration.

  <title>Stringp, Nil Error in Emacs</title>

This is one of those posts that serve only to remind me of something in the future. My Emacs configuration was working well on one machine.  Whenever I opened dired on another machine, though, this error was returned:
</p>

 <p>
 <code>wrong type argument: stringp, nil</code>
</p>

 <p>
Finally, I remembered that I had required GNU ls in my Emacs settings, and had not installed it on the machine in question. A quick “brew install coreutils” to install the GNU Command Line Tools with Homebrew did the trick.

Gracious God, <br></br>

Speaking of interesting, free resources,  <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">DuoLingo</a> is a site reminiscent of Rosetta Stone. I’ve started the German course for review, and it seems to be very well done so far. I notice that they have Danish — maybe it’s time to get serious about studying Kierkegaard.

Great God of beauty and wonder,
</p>

 <p>
There are days when I wish <br></br>
that you had given us <br></br>
a blueprint for life, <br></br>
with every step <br></br>
mapped out in detail, <br></br>
and every decision <br></br>
already made.
</p>

 <p>
Instead, you gave us <br></br>
each a life for a canvas, <br></br>
and gifts and talents <br></br>
for a palette and brushes, <br></br>
the Spirit for our guide, <br></br>
and the Son for our model, <br></br>
then you sent us out <br></br>
into the world to paint.
</p>

 <p>
Now, with the loving eye <br></br>
of the great artist who painted <br></br>
the night sky with stars, <br></br>
help us to create something beautiful <br></br>
with you.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

And life since the Holocaust always seemed to surprise him for the better, and there was no bitterness in him. He said, “You know what? I’ve been smoking two packs a day since I was 14 years old for more than 65 years and if after that you get a cancer, it’s a fair deal,” he says. “It’s fair. I’ve got nothing to complain [about] and I’ve lived a full life, I want to live as much as I can, but when I die when I die, I won’t go out kicking and screaming.”

 <p>
Could it be that the force of the problem of evil is a matter of one’s attitude? What is the difference between people who focus on their suffering and those who focus on their overcoming that suffering?

A poem by James Weldon Johnson (June 17, 1871 – June 26, 1938), American author, educator, lawyer, diplomat, and civil rights activist.
</p>

 <p>
Nine people were shot in a historic church in Charleston, South Carolina, this week, and the evidence points to it being a racist hate-crime. So, 144 years and 1 day after his birth, we are reminded that some things, unfortunately have not changed.
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
 <b>America</b>
</p>

 <p>
How would you have us, as we are? <br></br>
Or sinking ’neath the load we bear? <br></br>
Our eyes fixed forward on a star? <br></br>
Or gazing empty at despair?
</p>

 <p>
Rising or falling? Men or things? <br></br>
With dragging pace or footsteps fleet? <br></br>
Strong, willing sinews in your wings? <br></br>
Or tightening chains about your feet?

 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jun 21, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
A reflection on the lives lost this week in Charleston, and the responsibility that we bear, either explicitly or implicitly:
</p>

 <p>
God of justice,
</p>

 <p>
We are told that heaven rejoices <br></br>
over what has been found, <br></br>
does heaven also weep for <br></br>
what has been lost? <br></br> <br></br>
For the one whose heart <br></br>
was lost in hatred, <br></br>
and whose mind was <br></br>
filled with empty lies? <br></br> <br></br>
For the nine lives that <br></br>
were taken in an act <br></br>
of unspeakable horror? <br></br> <br></br>
Does heaven also mourn <br></br>
at the loss of our hope, <br></br>
or does heaven simply sigh, <br></br>
for that hope was <br></br>
always vain and self-serving? <br></br> <br></br>
For we hoped that <br></br>
things would get better <br></br>
as time passed, <br></br>
with no effort, and no cost, <br></br> <br></br>
We hoped to measure our lives <br></br>
by the things that we have, <br></br>
and not by the people that we ignore, <br></br> <br></br>
We hoped that it would <br></br>
be enough to just not hate, <br></br>
even if we could not really love. <br></br> <br></br>
Forgive us, Lord, <br></br>
for the sin of settling for <br></br>
something less than than <br></br>
the full Kingdom of God, <br></br> <br></br>
But even more for the <br></br>
greater sin of never <br></br>
really wanting it at all.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

I install Emacs with  <a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>. After installing Homebrew, just type the following in Terminal:
</p>

 <p>
 <code>brew install emacs --cocoa</code>
</p>

 <p>
This makes upgrading very easy, `brew upgrade` updates everything that you’ve installed in Homebrew. It also keeps things nicely organized in  <i>usr/local/Cellar</i> and puts symbolic links in  <i>usr/local/bin</i>. After installation, you have two options for getting Emacs into your Applications directory. First, Homebrew can put a link there with `brew linkapps Emacs`. Second, you can copy Emacs to /Applications with
</p>

 <p>
 <code>cp -r /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/24.5/Emacs.app /Applications/</code>
</p>
</div>
</section> <section id="outline-container-org842ba58" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="org842ba58">Prelude</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org842ba58">
 <p>
I use  <a href="http://batsov.com/prelude/">Emacs Prelude</a>, a starter kit by Bozhidar Batsov. There are many Emacs users that advocate setting up your own configuration from scratch, and I’ve done that many times. I keep coming back to Prelude, though, it just makes the initial work so much easier. Prelude includes a personal directory for individual configuration files. I keep all of those files in a git repository located in Dropbox with symbolic links in the Prelude personal directory. That way, I can use Github for version control, but have all machines in sync with no effort.
</p>

 <p>
There are two important files in my personal directory. The first is an emacs-lisp file containing this:
</p>


 <pre class="example" id="org5123b9c">
;;Load emacs personal settings via org
(prelude-require-package 'org)
(org-babel-load-file
(expand-file-name "personal/settings.org" user-emacs-directory))
</pre>

 <p>
This file loads an org-mode file that contains the actual configuration.
</p>
</div>
</section> <section id="outline-container-orge614133" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="orge614133">Starting Emacs</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge614133">
 <p>
I like to start Emacs using the daemon, which keeps an Emacs server running in the background, then connect to that server with Emacs Client. This makes opening Emacs nearly instantaneous.
</p>

 <p>
In the past, I’ve done this from the terminal by putting with these aliases in my zshrc:
</p>


 <ul class="org-ul"> <li> <code>alias daemon</code>“emacs –daemon”=</li>
 <li> <code>alias ec</code>“emacsclient -c -a ‘’”=</li>
 <li> <code>alias ef</code>“emacsclient -c -a ‘’ -F ’((fullscreen . maximized))’”=</li>
 <li> <code>alias e</code>“emacsclient -t”=</li>
</ul> <p>
The first simply starts the server. I never used it, because the second would connect to the server one were already running, otherwise, it would start one, then connect to it. The third does the same thing, but starts an Emacs client with a maximized frame.
</p>

 <p>
This worked well, but I usually use Alfred to start applications, not the terminal. After trying many options, I ran across these instructions by  <a href="http://blog.haberkucharsky.com/tech/2015/01/26/emacs-on-osx.html%20">Jesse Haber-Kucharsky</a>. I created the Emacs Daemon application with one change, instead of using Emacs in  <i>Applications, I had the script point directly to /usr/local/bin</i> instead. I created the three shell scripts as directed, but instead of the Emacs-Cocoa application, I created one called “Emacs Client” that started the “ec” script. The daemon runs at startup, then I call Emacs Client from Alfred whenever I want to start Emacs.
</p>

 <p>
There are parts of this that I really didn’t need to do, but too much is better than not enough, I suppose.

 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jul 05, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
God of love and grace,
</p>

 <p>
Before there was anything else, <br></br>
there was love, <br></br>
perfect and pure.
</p>

 <p>
It was a love so full <br></br>
that it manifested itself <br></br>
in the creation of the infinite universe <br></br>
in all of its beauty and diversity.
</p>

 <p>
We rejoice today with those <br></br>
who shed tears of joy <br></br>
when, against all odds, <br></br>
love won.
</p>

 <p>
Our joy, though, is not yet complete, <br></br>
as we grieve today with those <br></br>
who shed tears of sorrow <br></br>
when, as churches burned, <br></br>
hate seemed to overcome.
</p>

 <p>
But even now, as we stand <br></br>
between the forces of hate <br></br>
and the forces of love, <br></br>
we will not despair, <br></br>
for we know which side <br></br>
you are on. <br></br></p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

  <title>Guns, Cakes, and Gay Weddings</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jul 07, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Guns, Cakes, and Gay Weddings</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jul 07, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Internet memes rarely constitute a high level of discourse, but they can sometimes prompt interesting conversations. This morning, a friend posted one that read,
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
If selling a gay couple a wedding cake means a “christian” baker participated in their marriage, does selling a gun to a murderer mean a “christian” gun store owner participated in the murder?
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
The gun store owner does indeed participate in the murder, though not in a way that makes him <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> morally responsible for the murder. He is even more of a participant in the murder than the baker is a participant in the marriage, because the actions of the gun store owner, however unwitting, are causally significant in a way that the actions of the baker are not. All other things being equal, without the gun, there would have been no murder. All other things being equal, without the cake, the couple would still be married.
</p>

 <p>
The important question with respect to the gun store owner is what kind of participation is required for moral culpability. Although negligence complicates things, let’s assume that one is morally responsible for what one knowingly participates in. Since the gun dealer is not aware, (nor negligently unware — that is, there’s no sign posted saying “If you plan to commit a murder with this firearm, please do not tell me…”) then the store owner is not morally responsible.
</p>

 <p>
From what some service providers have said, though, it’s not participation  <i>per se</i> that is the problem, it’s that their participation could be viewed as tacit approval. I don’t understand why that’s the case — we wouldn’t take a Bar Mitzvah cake baked by a Christian baker to imply approval of Judaism, an  <i>Eid-al-Fitr</i> cake to be an approval of Islam, or a Super Bowl cake to imply approval of professional sports.
</p>

 <p>
Maybe the gun case is not close enough to be a good analogy. Maybe we should instead ask if the Christian restaurant owner is a culpable participant in my act of gluttony by selling me overly large portions with the full expectation that I will eat it all on the spot.

I usually mix masculine and feminine pronouns to avoid sexist language, but in this case, I think it’s reasonable to assume that most gun store owners are male.

As I listened to Mitch Randall’s sermon last Sunday at NorthHaven Church in Norman, Oklahoma, I couldn’t help but reflect on Paul’s words in Philippians 2. I hope the prayer for the week reflects that thought.
</p>

 <p>
Father,
</p>

 <p>
Protect us from the arrogance <br></br>
of unwarranted certainty, <br></br>
as it keeps us from hearing <br></br>
the voice of our neighbor.
</p>

 <p>
Cleanse us from the vanity <br></br>
of inflated self-importance, <br></br>
as it moves us to see only ourselves.
</p>

 <p>
May we never desire a freedom <br></br>
that forces others to worship as we do, <br></br>
for that is not the way of the one <br></br>
who took up, not his rights, <br></br>
but the cross.
</p>

 <p>
In his name, <br></br> <i>Amen</i>
</p>

  <title>Open Dired From Shell</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jul 08, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Open Dired From Shell</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jul 08, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
I was browsing the interwebs this morning, looking for a way to open a Dired buffer of the current finder window. There is a lot on going the other way, from Emacs to the Finder, but nothing from the Finder to Emacs.
I got this from  <a href="http://datko.net/2013/07/11/open-emacs-dired-buffer-from-dired/%20">Fortune Datko</a>:
</p>

 <p>
Add this to your shell rc file (in my case, .zshrc):
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="org42691e0">
# open a dired window for the current directory
dired() {
    emacsclient -e "(dired \"$PWD\")"
}
</pre>

 <p>
Then, assuming that Emacs server is running, type “`dired`” in the shell, and a Dired
buffer of that directory opens in the current Emacs frame.
</p>

 <p>
Just out of curiosity, I wondered what typing “`emacsclient -c .`” would do. It opens a dired buffer in a new frame. I have a shell script called “ec” that starts a new emacs client, but it’s easy to do it with a zsh alias:
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="orgc1c05b5">
alias ec="emacsclient -c -a ''"
</pre>

 <p>
This starts a server if there is not one already, then opens a new client. So, typing `ec .` should then open a Dired buffer in a new frame.
</p>

  <title>Strength Enough?</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jul 12, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Strength Enough?</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jul 12, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Mike Bumgarner quoted part of this passage in a sermon this morning. It is worth reflecting on:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
This is where a tremendous decision takes place: whether we Christians have enough strength to witness before the world that we are not dreamers with our heads in the clouds… that our faith really is not opium that keeps us content within an unjust world. Instead, and precisely because our minds are set on things above, we are that much more stubborn and purposeful in protesting here on earth… Does it have to be that Christianity, which began as immensely revolutionary, now has to remain conservative for all time? That every new movement has to blaze its path without the church, and that the church always takes twenty years to see what has actually happened? If it really must be so, then we must not be surprised when, for our church as well, times come when the blood of martyrs will be demanded. But this blood if we truly have the courage and honour and loyalty to shed it, will not be so innocent and shining as that of the first witnesses. Our blood will be overlaid with our own great guilt.
</p>

  <title>Go to Your Pastor for Depression?</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Aug 13, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Go to Your Pastor for Depression?</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Aug 13, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Glennon Doyle Melton at  <a href="http://momastery.com/blog/">momastery.com</a> posted an article with the provocative title, “ <a href="http://momastery.com/blog/2015/08/12/ministers-depression/?utm_content=bufferff8d8&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer">If You Wouldn’t Go to Your Minister for a Mammogram, Don’t Go for Depression</a>.” In it, she makes the important point that there are those in Christian communities that advocate treatment of depression through prayer alone, refusing to see it as a medical condition, yet those same people would not treat cancer simply with prayer. In this, I wholeheartedly agree. Ministers harm those whom they counsel when they do not urge them to seek medical help for mental illness.
</p>

 <p>
At the same time, though, I think the title of the post does a disservice to those who might read it. First, recognize that the analogy is particularly weak. Depression is a condition, a mammogram is a diagnostic tool. A better analogy would be this, “If you wouldn’t go to your minister because you have cancer, don’t go because you have depression.” So, the question, then, should be “Would you go to your minister if you had cancer?” I certainly hope that the answer is yes; cancer may not be a spiritual condition, but surely having cancer affects one’s spirit, and the patient should get as much support as she can. In the same way, having depression affects one’s spirit, and support from a caring pastoral counselor should be valued.
</p>

 <p>
Is pastoral counseling good treatment for the depression itself? No, but then again, neither is a mammogram good treatment for cancer.

  <title>Hiding in Gods Own Sanctuary</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Sep 07, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Hiding in Gods Own Sanctuary</h1>

“Where are you?”
</p>

 <p>
The sound of heartbreak <br></br>
rang through the garden <br></br>
as the Lord went out <br></br>
in the cool of the evening <br></br>
to meet his children, <br></br>
who hid in the place <br></br>
that he gave them, <br></br>
a place made for <br></br>
fellowship with God.
</p>

 <p>
God still calls, <br></br>
and we still hide, <br></br>
in places built for <br></br>
communion with him, <br></br>
masking our shame and fear <br></br>
by doing the good while <br></br>
failing to hear his call <br></br>
to something great.
</p>

 <p>
Father, forgive us.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

Gracious God, Giver of life,
</p>

 <p>
Long ago, <br></br>
a tree was planted by your grace <br></br>
and watered by your providential care.
</p>

 <p>
It was robbed of <br></br>
life and beauty, <br></br>
and used to fashion a cross <br></br>
to bear body of the Christ, <br></br>
broken for our redemption.
</p>

 <p>
And so, Lord, like that tree, <br></br>
we have been planted, <br></br>
watered, and have grown, <br></br>
yet the time has come for us <br></br>
to offer our lives to you, <br></br>
not just to bear, <br></br>
but to become <br></br>
the body of Christ <br></br>
in this world.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>The Perfect Church</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Sep 25, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">The Perfect Church</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Sep 25, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
A prayer for those searching for the perfect church:
</p>

 <p>
Lord Jesus,
</p>

 <p>
We move from <br></br>
church to church, <br></br>
searching for one <br></br>
that meets our needs, <br></br>
one that is perfect <br></br>
for people like us. <br></br> <br></br>
But what do we hope to find? <br></br>
A church filled <br></br>
with perfect people? <br></br>
People who have no faults, <br></br>
who speak no unkind words, <br></br>
who never hurt one another, <br></br>
and never have regrets? <br></br> <br></br>
A perfect church, indeed, <br></br>
but a church with no place <br></br>
for one like me, <br></br>
a broken spirit <br></br>
who needs <br></br>
grace, <br></br>
love, <br></br>
healing, <br></br>
and mercy. <br></br> <br></br>
And so, I bow in prayer, <br></br>
to ask for a church <br></br>
filled with those <br></br>
who are broken and flawed, <br></br>
hurting and in sorrow, <br></br>
who are there because <br></br>
they know that together, <br></br>
with you, <br></br>
they can find <br></br>
grace and mercy, <br></br>
healing, and hope <br></br>
in that place <br></br>
they call their church. <br></br> <br></br>
Then I open my eyes <br></br>
to find that my prayer <br></br>
has already been answered. <br></br> <br></br>
Thank you, Lord, <br></br>
for leading me home. <br></br></p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>Gun Violence — A Prayer</title>

 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Oct 04, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Grieving for the lives lost in Oregon, a <br></br>
prayer for World Communion Sunday, 2015:
</p>

 <p>
Merciful God,
</p>

 <p>
At least three while <br></br>
we sit in worship,
</p>

 <p>
Eighty today, <br></br>
as we rest <br></br>
on the Sabbath,
</p>

 <p>
Thirty thousand lives <br></br>
lost in a single year.
</p>

 <p>
Some were taken <br></br>
by their own hand, <br></br>
some by accident, <br></br>
still others by strangers.
</p>

 <p>
All were lost in <br></br>
brutal acts of violence, <br></br>
sacrificed on the altar <br></br>
of our rights.
</p>

 <p>
Christ gave up everything <br></br>
so that I might have life, <br></br>
what am I willing to give up
so that others may live?
</p>

 <p>
Lord, have mercy.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>Prayer for a Unified Church</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Prayer for a Unified Church</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Oct 11, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Holy God,
</p>

 <p>
Forgive us for those times <br></br></p>

 <p>
When individuality was more <br></br>
important to us than community…
</p>

 <p>
When being right was more <br></br>
important to us than being loving…
</p>

 <p>
When our own agendas were more <br></br>
important to us than your Kingdom…
</p>

 <p>
When our own labels were more <br></br>
important to us than the name of Christ.
</p>

 <p>
Give us now a new vision <br></br>
of that which binds us together,
</p>

 <p>
The same baptism, <br></br>
in response to the same call, <br></br>
to fulfill the same mission, <br></br>
in service to the same Lord.
</p>

 <p>
For then, we sill see in others, <br></br>
not differences to be feared, <br></br>
but diversity to be embraced,
</p>

 <p>
Modeling before the world, <br></br>
the beauty of the Triune God, <br></br></p>

 <p>
Father, Son, and Spirit, <br></br></p>

 <p>
Three persons, <br></br>
but one God, <br></br></p>

 <p>
Forever and ever,
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

God of grace,
</p>

 <p>
On the door of the church, <br></br>
Luther proclaimed his message,
</p>

 <p>
“The true treasure of the church <br></br>
is the most holy gospel <br></br>
of the glory and grace of God.”
</p>

 <p>
A treasure too great <br></br>
to be kept to ourselves, <br></br>
yet why is that <br></br>
we who have received <br></br>
so much grace somehow <br></br>
seem to have so little <br></br>
left to offer?
</p>

 <p>
Forgive me, Lord, <br></br>
and let me never again <br></br>
confuse your river of grace <br></br>
with the cesspool of <br></br>
my self-righteousness.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

Lord, <br></br></p>

 <p>
We search for heroes <br></br>
among the rich, powerful, <br></br>
strong and proud — <br></br>
those who look more <br></br>
like the crucifiers <br></br>
than the crucified. <br></br></p>

 <p>
But on this day, <br></br>
we give thanks <br></br>
for those for whom <br></br>
loving is more important <br></br>
than being loved, <br></br>
and faithfulness more <br></br>
dear than fame. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Not our idols, Lord, <br></br>
instead, your saints. <br></br></p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

Lord Jesus,
</p>

 <p>
You invite us <br></br>
to lay down our <br></br>
burdens, cares, concerns, <br></br>
fears, and anxieties, <br></br>
and give them all to you.
</p>

 <p>
Then, wrapped in the <br></br>
sweet warmth of your grace, <br></br>
we can dance in joy <br></br>
before the throne, <br></br>
as beloved children <br></br>
of the Father <br></br>
who have finally <br></br>
found their way home. <br></br></p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>A Prayerful Response</title>

  <summary>Nov 15, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">A Prayerful Response</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Nov 15, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
 <i>As we mourn for the lives lost this week in Paris, Lord, hear our prayer.</i>
</p>

 <p>
Almighty God,
</p>

 <p>
We grieve this week, <br></br>
crying with those who suffer, <br></br>
lamenting with those who mourn.
</p>

 <p>
Even in our anger, <br></br>
May we always seek justice, <br></br>
and never revenge; <br></br>
healing, not harm; <br></br>
and a measured response, <br></br>
instead of thoughtless reaction.
</p>

 <p>
When circumstances tempt us <br></br>
to sink into the depths of despair, <br></br>
may we hear the prophet’s voice, <br></br>
as he surveyed the destruction of Jerusalem <br></br>
yet still found hope,
</p>

 <p>
“The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases, <br></br>
his mercies never come to an end; <br></br>
they are new every morning, <br></br>
great is your faithfulness.”
</p>

 <p>
When faced with the choice <br></br>
between burning hatred <br></br>
and callous indifference, <br></br>
remind us again that there is a third way, <br></br>
the way of love.
</p>

 <p>
And may that love shine so brightly <br></br>
that the entire world will know, <br></br>
the light still shines in the darkness, <br></br>
and the darkness will never defeat it.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Nov 15, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
I recently started using John Wiegley’s [use-package]( <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package">https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package</a> ) for my Emacs init files. For Auctex, I used
</p>


 <pre class="example" id="org1958c68">
(use-package tex
    :ensure auctex)
</pre>

 <p>
and everything worked except for sync with Skim on OS X.  <code>C-c v</code> would not launch the Skim, even though I was confident that the Skim was set to be the default viewer. Instead, no viewer would launch, and I’d see “View command: dvi2tty -q -w 132” in the minibuffer.
</p>

 <p>
After seeing that some others had used a slightly different configuration, I changed mine to
</p>


 <pre class="example" id="orgfe0e8de">
(use-package tex-site
    :ensure auctex)
</pre>


 <p>
and everything started working fine. I still have no idea why, but it may help someone else.

Father,
</p>

 <p>
I’m surrounded by voices <br></br>
telling me what I want to hear, <br></br>
voices urging me to seek my own good, <br></br>
to protect what is mine, <br></br>
that my security is more important <br></br>
than the needs of others.
</p>

 <p>
Help me, Lord, <br></br>
to hear a different message, <br></br>
one that challenges me <br></br>
to become something <br></br>
better than I have been, <br></br>
and to dismantle my own petty kingdom <br></br>
for the sake of the Kingdom of God.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>Prayer of Hope</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Prayer of Hope</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Nov 29, 2015 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
 <b>For the First Sunday of Advent</b>
</p>

 <p>
God of all hope,
</p>

 <p>
When those seeking food and shelter <br></br>
are told only to pray to Jesus,
</p>

 <p>
When those fleeing the devastation of war <br></br>
are told only to go to Jesus,
</p>

 <p>
And when those who <br></br>
have lost all hope <br></br>
are told only to hope in Jesus,
</p>

 <p>
Then, Lord, I have failed.
</p>

 <p>
For if I will not welcome <br></br>
those whom the world now rejects, <br></br>
then why would I welcome the child <br></br>
whom the world did reject?
</p>

 <p>
So, instead of the usual <br></br>
empty platitudes of the season, <br></br>
may I offer real hope, <br></br>
a hope that feeds, <br></br>
clothes, and shelters, <br></br>
heals broken lives, <br></br>
and mends broken spirits.
</p>

 <p>
In the name of Christ,
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>Prayer for the Joy of Advent</title>

</header> <p>
God of joy,
</p>

 <p>
A cacophony of voices <br></br>
demand our daily attention, <br></br>
some calling us to <br></br>
the bitter resignation <br></br>
of despair, others, to the <br></br>
sweet, but empty, vanity <br></br>
of self-righteousness.
</p>

 <p>
Joy, though, speaks with <br></br>
a quiet and unassuming voice, <br></br>
much like a babe born <br></br>
to poor parents and <br></br>
laid in a manger to sleep.
</p>

 <p>
Cleanse my heart <br></br>
of the cynicism that <br></br>
blocks the empty noise <br></br>
of the season, <br></br>
at the expense <br></br>
of the possibility <br></br>
of hearing the joy <br></br>
of Advent.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>Prayer for the Fourth Sunday of Advent</title>

  <summary>Dec 22, 2015 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Prayer for the Fourth Sunday of Advent</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Dec 22, 2015 00:00</p>

Holy God,
</p>

 <p>
When a new emperor <br></br>
took the throne, <br></br>
messengers were sent <br></br>
to the rich and powerful <br></br>
to deliver “glad tidings” <br></br>
of Caesar, who was called <br></br>
“savior and lord” and <br></br>
promised to bring <br></br>
peace to the empire <br></br>
through the power <br></br>
of his vast riches <br></br>
and his mighty armies.
</p>

 <p>
But when the King was born, <br></br>
messengers from God were sent, <br></br>
not to the rich and powerful, <br></br>
but to those too poor <br></br>
to be noticed by the empire.
</p>

 <p>
And for the first time, <br></br>
they heard glad tidings <br></br>
of good news, that peace <br></br>
would come to the world, <br></br>
not by the power of force <br></br>
but through the power of love.
</p>

 <p>
Look within my heart, Lord, <br></br>
this Christmas season.
</p>

 <p>
May what you find there <br></br>
reflect the humility <br></br>
of the ones to whom <br></br>
your messengers <br></br>
were first sent.
</p>

 <p>
And forgive me for when <br></br>
I’ve turned the celebration <br></br>
of your birth into something <br></br>
that served the empire <br></br>
more than it did your Kingdom.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

Prayer for an evening of frantic packing before a trip to Africa. I’ll be teaching philosophy of religion at a Baptist seminary in Ghana for the next two weeks.
</p>

 <p>
Lord,
</p>

 <p>
If I really need it, <br></br>
help me to remember to pack it.

 <p>
If I really don’t need it, <br></br>
help me to resist the temptation to take it.

 <p>
And if I need it and forget it, <br></br>
may it be something I would have lost over there anyway.

After reflecting on my time dancing during the service at Koinonia Baptist Church in Tamale, Ghana. There are pictures, there might even be some video.
</p>

 <p>
God of joy,
</p>

 <p>
Forgive me for the many times <br></br>
when what others were thinking <br></br>
was more important to me <br></br>
than expressing my praise to you.
</p>

 <p>
Remove any inhibition <br></br>

and may my heart be <br></br>
so filled with joy <br></br>
that I cannot help <br></br>
but to dance <br></br>
before the throne of God.

A prayer prompted by praying with friends in Ghana who pray and give thanks for everything, from resting well through the night to waking up the next morning.
</p>

 <p>
Gracious God,
</p>

 <p>
As I begin the day, <br></br>
may I remember <br></br>
to trust in your grace <br></br>
for what I need, <br></br>
no matter how great, <br></br>
no matter how small.
</p>

 <p>
And as I end this day, <br></br>
may I remember to give thanks <br></br>
for what I have been given, <br></br>
no matter how great, <br></br>
no matter how small.
</p>

 <p>
For every good thing <br></br>
is a gift from you, <br></br>
and even a small gift <br></br>
is priceless when received <br></br>
from the hand of God.
</p>

 <p>
Amen
</p>

A prayer after a week in which I had made prior commitments for four straight evenings following the thirty hour trip back from Ghana:
</p>

 <p>
Grant us, Lord, <br></br>
the strength and energy <br></br>
to do those things <br></br>
that we’ve agreed to do, <br></br>
and the wisdom to know <br></br>
when to agree to something <br></br>
in the first place.
</p>

 <p>
Amen

We left Accra, Ghana at 2300 last Saturday night. After thirty hours of traveling, we arrived in Oklahoma City. Monday night, I had to go visit my father at his hospital. Tuesday and Wednesday, I taught a Bible study on forgiveness at First Baptist Church, Sparks, OK. Thursday night, I had my three hour political philosophy class. Finally, on Friday, I came down with a stomach bug, for which I should be thankful — I went to bed and slept for eighteen hours.

  <title>Outside the Beautiful Gate</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Outside the Beautiful Gate</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Feb 01, 2016 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
God of compassion,
</p>

 <p>
Peter and John met a man <br></br>
asking for alms <br></br>
at the Beautiful Gate <br></br>
of the temple.
</p>

 <p>
We are not like Peter and John, <br></br>
when they met the man <br></br>
at the Beautiful Gate, <br></br>
for we do have <br></br>
silver and gold <br></br>
to give.
</p>

 <p>
But before we give, <br></br>
we pray that you <br></br>
would examine our hearts.
</p>

 <p>
Do we give to maintain <br></br>
the myth of our own superiority?
</p>

 <p>
Do we give as a a means of exercising power?
</p>

 <p>
Or do we give in a way that recognizes the <br></br>
other person as one who bears <br></br>
the image of Christ himself?
</p>

 <p>
“Look at us,” Peter said.
</p>

 <p>
Look at us, Lord. <br></br>
Look with us. <br></br>
Look through us.
</p>

 <p>
Help us to see the ones <br></br>
sitting outside our own <br></br>
Beautiful Gates.
</p>

 <p>
Amen
</p>

  <title>Prayer for Ash Wednesday</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Prayer for Ash Wednesday</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Feb 10, 2016 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Holy God,
</p>

 <p>
You call us into the night, <br></br>
into the darkness, <br></br>
to a place without distraction <br></br>
where we can see only ourselves, <br></br>
not as we wish we were, <br></br>
but as we truly are.
</p>

 <p>
We come hesitantly, <br></br>
for we are afraid <br></br>
to acknowledge <br></br>
what we have become.
</p>

 <p>
We come trembling, <br></br>
knowing that hearts <br></br>
that are hard <br></br>
must somehow be broken.
</p>

 <p>
We come with hope, <br></br>
knowing that what <br></br>
is broken can <br></br>
again be made whole <br></br>
by the unending <br></br>
love of God.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>The Ashes of Our Idols</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Feb 11, 2016 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">The Ashes of Our Idols</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Feb 11, 2016 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
 <i>A sermon for Ash Wednesday delivered at NorthHaven Church, Norman, OK on February 10, 2016.</i>
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. A new heart I will give you, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will remove from your body the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. (Ezekiel 36:25-26)
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
Every year, a scene is portrayed in churches around the world. Sometimes the choir processes in, sometimes not; but one thing will very likely happen — children will march in waving palm branches, as these words are either sung or shouted, “Hosanna! Hosanna in the highest! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!”
</p>

 <p>
The day, of course, is Palm Sunday, the day that we commemorate the entry of Jesus into Jerusalem. John records the incident in chapter 12 of his Gospel: the crowd had heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. So, John tells us, they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Jesus, shouting the very same things that we will hear the children shout in a few weeks. In response, the text says that Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, a fulfillment of the prophecy in Zechariah 9.
</p>

 <p>
Then the story takes a puzzling turn. See verse 20:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
Now among those who went up to worship at the festival were some Greeks. They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him, “Sir, we wish to see Jesus.” Philip went and told Andrew; then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. Jesus answered them, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.”
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
Over the next thirteen verses, Jesus talks about how his hour to be glorified has come, and it will be by his death. The scene closes in verse 36, “After Jesus had said this, he departed and hid from them.”
</p>

 <p>
Jesus is asked about some Greeks that want to see him. He doesn’t say, “Bring them to me,” or “Not now, I have other things on my mind.” He doesn’t say anything about the Greeks at all! What’s puzzling about this passage is not what Jesus said, but how John introduced it. Why not just say something simple, like “Jesus turned to his disciples and said….” Why talk about the Greeks at all?
</p>

 <p>
<!– It’s puzzling — almost as puzzling as my talking about Palm Sunday here on Ash Wednesday, in a sermon that’s supposed to be on a passage from Ezekiel about idolatry. –>
</p>

 <p>
Of course, there’s another puzzle that we don’t really talk about. Why do the people go get palm branches? None of the Gospels bother to explain the significance of the branches. Finally, there’s the greatest puzzle of all: how can shouts of praises on Sunday so quickly turn to calls for crucifixion on Friday?
</p>

 <p>
The Gospels treat these matters as if they were obvious. Well, they  <b>were</b> obvious, at least to their original readers, for they knew their Jewish history.
</p>

 <p>
After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE, his vast empire was divided between his Greek generals. The Ptolemies ruled the south from Egypt, and the Seleucids ruled the east from Persia. At first, Judea was under the control of the Ptolemies, who gave the Jews a great deal of religious and cultural freedom. In 198 BCE, the Seleucids defeated the Ptolemies, and took control of Judea.  Part of the Seleucid agenda was the Hellenization of the empire, that is, extending Greek culture throughout the empire. This reached a climax in Israel during the reign of Emperor Antiochus IV Epiphanes when a statue of Zeus was erected in the temple at Jerusalem, and a pig was sacrificed on the altar of God.
</p>

 <p>
Soldiers were sent to the towns and villages to enforce the Hellenization. In one town, they were met by a country priest named Mattathias, who was ordered to sacrifice an animal to the altar of an idol. Mattathias refused, killing first a Jewish man who volunteered to perform the sacrifice, then killing the officer who gave the order, and then, with his five sons, rallied the people to revolt. The family became known as the Maccabees, or “hammer.” Under the leadership of one of the sons, Judas Maccabees, the Jews defeated the Seleucids against overwhelming odds. They then cleansed the temple in 164 BCE, an event which is commemorated by the celebration of Hanukkah.
</p>

 <p>
Chapter 13 of the apocryphal book 1 Maccabees records the victorious entrance of the Jews into Jerusalem:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
On the twenty- third day of the second month, in the one hundred seventy- first year, the Jews entered it with praise and palm branches, and with harps and cymbals and stringed instruments, and with hymns and songs, because a great enemy had been crushed and removed from Israel.
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
Judas Maccabees was praised as “the savior of Israel.”
</p>

 <p>
Just 100 years later, Pompey the Great took Jerusalem, and Israel was once again subject to foreign rule, not by Greeks this time, but by Romans. So, it is really no surprise that the people waved palm branches and shouted, for they saw in Jesus a new Judas Maccabees, another hammer to pound the enemies of God. Just in case the reader might miss the point, John brought in some Greeks to make it clear. The people wanted a new savior who would drive out the hated foreign tyrant and restore Israel to its glory, someone to fulfill Zechariah 9:13,
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
For I have bent Judah as my bow;
I have made Ephraim its arrow.
I will arouse your sons, O Zion,
against your sons, O Greece,
and wield you like a warrior’s sword.
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
They wanted a warrior king who would ride victoriously into Jerusalem on that great symbol of Ancient Near Eastern power, a chariot pulled by a giant warhorse, a messiah bearing the weapons of destruction.
</p>

 <p>
Instead, Jesus chose a donkey.
</p>

 <p>
You see, Jesus had this unsettling habit of fulfilling all of the Scriptures, not just the ones that we wanted fulfilled. By choosing the donkey, Jesus forces us to look up from Zechariah 9:13 and see verses 9-10:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
Rejoice greatly, O daughter Zion!
Shout aloud, O daughter Jerusalem!
Lo, your king comes to you;
triumphant and victorious is he,
humble and riding on a donkey,
on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
He will cut off the chariot from Ephraim
and the war- horse from Jerusalem;
and the battle bow shall be cut off,
and he shall command peace to the nations;
his dominion shall be from sea to sea,
and from the River to the ends of the earth.
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
The people wanted a warrior, but instead they got a servant. They dreamt of armies and chariots, instead, they got the cross. The cries of hosanna were not praises to the messiah who was in their midst, but acts of worship to an idol of their own creation. The palm branches that they waved were symbols of their idolatrous devotion to the god that they wanted, a god that could be manipulated to achieve their own goals and satisfy their own desires.
</p>

 <p>
Jesus, though, refused to be manipulated. Matthew, Mark, and Luke tell us that, just like the Maccabean revolt, the first thing that Jesus did after entering the city was to cleanse the temple. Unlike the time of the Maccabees, though, the temple had not been defiled by foreigners, but by those who claimed, and probably sincerely believed, that they were doing the work of God.
</p>

 <p>
The most dangerous idols, like the most dangerous lies, have an element of truth. Sometimes the most destructive idolatry is the idolatry of our own religion.
</p>

 <p>
The Scripture readings for Ash Wednesday confront us again and again  with this question: who is the true object of our worship? Is it God, or is ourselves?
</p>

 <p>
Does your Jesus want the very same things you want? Does your Jesus love the same people you love? Does your Jesus hate the same people you hate? Does your Jesus have an agenda that fits easily into your own agenda? Does your Jesus never say anything that makes you uncomfortable? If so, then you may well be following the god you created, not the God who created you.
</p>

 <p>
Ezekiel’s diagnosis is clear — our true idols are ourselves. The people waved their palm branches, not because they wanted to serve Jesus, but because they wanted Jesus to serve them. The objects of our worship are our own hearts, hearts of stone that are cold, hard, dry, brittle, and dead.
</p>

 <p>
The ashes that we use on Ash Wednesday were, just a few hours before, the palm branches from the previous year. Once vibrant and green, but after nearly a year, they are cold, hard, dry, brittle, and dead, perfect symbols of our hearts. The good news of the gospel, though, is that the hard heart can be made soft, dry eyes can again be filled with tears, and a dead faith can certainly be made alive. John’s vision in Revelation 7 gives us hope:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
After this I looked, and there was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, robed in white, with palm branches in their hands.
</p>
</blockquote>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
They cried out in a loud voice, saying,
"Salvation belongs to our God who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb!”
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
God will redeem the palm branches, and God will redeem our hearts.
</p>

 <p>
So, we come to this place, this evening, to ask God to change our hearts. We come, not with palm branches, but with the ashes of last year’s palm branches. We come, not to shout hosannas, but to hear that we are but dust. We come with the ashes of our idols, and we leave bearing the mark of the Cross — a visible testimony that there is nothing that God cannot transform, not even this heart of stone.
</p>

A prayer for the First Sunday of Lent:
</p>

 <p>
Father,
</p>

 <p>
The dying tree, <br></br>
desperate to stay alive, <br></br>
tries to maintain <br></br>
the illusion of being <br></br>
healthy and full, <br></br>
but it cannot <br></br>
hide the truth, <br></br>
for it saps life from <br></br>
everything around it.
</p>

 <p>
Forgive me, <br></br>
for I take much <br></br>
more than I give, <br></br>
and like the tree, <br></br>
never truly live.
</p>

 <p>
May these roots <br></br>
once again taste <br></br>
the goodness of <br></br>
your grace, and <br></br>
these branches <br></br>
be a blessing <br></br>
to all that <br></br>
I encounter.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>Prayer for the Desert</title>

  <summary>Feb 28, 2016 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Prayer for the Desert</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Feb 28, 2016 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
God of life,
</p>

 <p>
Sometimes our prayers are as parched as the desert <br></br>
and our hearts as dry as the dunes of sand.
</p>

 <p>
We take offense at things that don’t matter, <br></br>
but ignore the ones that do.
</p>

 <p>
When others are hungry, <br></br>
we are full.
</p>

 <p>
When others are hurting, <br></br>
we are numb.
</p>

 <p>
When others are cold, <br></br>
we rest comfortably <br></br>
beneath warm blankets of apathy.
</p>

 <p>
But even in our self-righteousness, <br></br>
we still feel something, <br></br>
a deep ache of longing, <br></br>
a thirst for something <br></br>
greater than ourselves, <br></br>
a lingering thought <br></br>
that you are still there. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Emmanuel, <br></br>
God with us. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Despite our weakness, <br></br>
you have called us to be your people, <br></br>
ambassadors of your kingdom.
</p>

 <p>
Lead us once more to the well of your grace, <br></br>
Bathe us again in the streams of your mercy.
</p>

 <p>
Open the floodgates of your love, <br></br>
and let the rivers flow.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

  <title>Faith and Power</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Faith and Power</h1>

</header> <p>
The text for Mitch Randall’s sermon was the story of Simon the magician in Acts 8. As I though about the passage, I was struck by Simon’s willingness to pay for the power to confer the Holy Spirit on others, that is, his desire to exchange financial power for religious power. That, in turn, prompted me to think about the current role of religion in politics.
</p>

 <p>
This week’s prayer:
</p>


 <p>
You know my heart, O Lord. <br></br>
The things that are hidden <br></br>
from me are laid bare <br></br>
before your eyes.
</p>

 <p>
What are the reasons <br></br>
for proclaiming my faith?
</p>

 <p>
Is it for your glory, <br></br>
or for my own?
</p>

 <p>
Is it to welcome <br></br>
others into your kingdom, <br></br>
or to exclude them <br></br>
from mine?
</p>

 <p>
We have turned faith <br></br>
into a commodity, <br></br>
something to buy and sell <br></br>
in the marketplace, <br></br>
and used your holy name <br></br>
as an instrument of <br></br>
worldly  power.
</p>

 <p>
Open my grasping hands, <br></br>
help me to raise them <br></br>
in service to others <br></br>
and in worship to you.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

Blessed Lord,
</p>

 <p>
You warned us of a broad path <br></br>
that leads to destruction, <br></br>
a path that so many seem to be walking.
</p>

 <p>
It is an easy path <br></br>
that calls us to <br></br>
give in to our temptations <br></br>
to hate, despise, and fear, <br></br>
to become something less <br></br>
than what you have created us to be.
</p>

 <p>
You have called us to a higher path,
</p>

 <p>
to renounce fear, <br></br>
and proclaim faith,
</p>

 <p>
to cast off hatred, <br></br>
and put on love,
</p>

 <p>
to reject exclusion, <br></br>
and embrace the world <br></br>
with open arms as wide <br></br>
as those that stretched out <br></br>
upon the cross for us,
</p>

 <p>
but not just for us.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Prayer for Palm Sunday</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Mar 20, 2016 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Prince of Peace,
</p>

 <p>
The palm branches <br></br>
waving in Jerusalem <br></br>
symbolized the dreams <br></br>
of the people, <br></br>
dreams of defeated enemies, <br></br>
and a peace gained by <br></br>
the overwhelming force of <br></br>
divine power and might.
</p>

 <p>
Instead of palms, <br></br>
we wave flags, <br></br>
grander symbols <br></br>
of the same dreams.
</p>

 <p>
Give us a new vision <br></br>
of a world where <br></br>
there are no enemies <br></br>
to vanquish and <br></br>
no wars to fight.
</p>

 <p>
Not because we have won, <br></br>
but because we have <br></br>
finally surrendered, <br></br>
and all of our weapons <br></br>
have been thrown down <br></br>
at the foot of the cross.
</p>

 <p>
Give me the courage to be the first.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

Gracious Father,
</p>

 <p>
Holy Saturday, <br></br>
the day of waiting, <br></br>
after all of our <br></br>
hopes and dreams <br></br>
have been crushed <br></br>
by a cruel world <br></br>
and a naive idealism <br></br>
is forced to succumb <br></br>
to a harsher reality.
</p>

 <p>
But even after the <br></br>
horrors of Friday, <br></br>
the morning sun still <br></br>
rose on Saturday.
</p>

 <p>
And we have hope, <br></br>
however faint, <br></br>
however absurd.
</p>

 <p>
So we wait, <br></br>
wait to see <br></br>
what Sunday <br></br>
will bring.
</p>

 <p>
Amen

</header> <p>
Lord Jesus,
</p>

 <p>
You warned the disciples <br></br>
to be wary of claims <br></br>
that the messiah had come. <br></br>
You said, “When told <br></br>
he is in the inner rooms, <br></br>
do not believe it.”
</p>

 <p>
When Thomas was told <br></br>
that you appeared <br></br>
in the inner rooms, <br></br>
he heeded your word <br></br>
and did not believe it <br></br>
until he saw for himself.
</p>

 <p>
And of those who claim <br></br>
to have special insight <br></br>
of your will for us, <br></br>
may we be like Thomas, <br></br>
the skeptical and <br></br>
obedient disciple.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

Thank you, Lord, <br></br>

As her faith grows, <br></br>
so may ours also.

  <title>Venn Diagrams with LaTeX and TikZ</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Apr 11, 2016 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Venn Diagrams with LaTeX and TikZ</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Apr 11, 2016 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
I spent the weekend working on Venn diagrams in LaTeX using TikZ to use when teaching categorical logic. I thought it was a much better use of my time than mowing the lawn, and one never knows when a good Venn diagram will be needed.
</p>
 <section id="outline-container-org4cc7ab9" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="org4cc7ab9">The Initial Diagram</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4cc7ab9">
 <p>
First, add the following to the preamble:
</p>


 <pre class="example" id="org4ad3dfa">
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes,backgrounds}
</pre>

 <p>
The next step is to define the three circles in the body of the document. This only needs to to be done once; they can be called repeatedly in the same document. I named them in a way that I could remember which was the subject term, middle term, and predicate term:
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="orgcd68514">
\def\sub{(0,0) circle (1.5cm)}
\def\mid{(-60:2cm) circle (1.5cm)}
\def\pred{(0:2cm) circle (1.5cm)}
</pre>


 <p>
Once the circles have been defined, they can be drawn and labeled. I prefer to use a heavier line than the default, that can be called as an option to  <code>tikzpicture</code>.
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="org806468e">
\begin{tikzpicture}[thick]

  \begin{scope}

    % Draw the circles
    \draw \sub;
    \draw \pred;
    \draw \mid;

    % Label the circles
    \draw (-2,-0) node {$S$};
    \draw (1,-4) node {$M$};
    \draw (4,0) node {$P$};

  \end{scope}

\end{tikzpicture}
</pre>

 <p>
This produces the following:
</p>



 <div class="org-center">

 <figure id="org96416db"> <img src="../images/posts/venn-labels.png" alt="venn-labels.png" width="75%"></img></figure></div>
</div>
</section> <section id="outline-container-orge2674dc" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="orge2674dc">Shading</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge2674dc">
</div>
 <div id="outline-container-orgf1632a8" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="orgf1632a8">Universal Negations</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf1632a8">
 <p>
Shading is simple with TikZ, and, in most cases, relatively intuitive. To shade an entire circle, use the “\fill” command. For example, “\fill ⊂” fills the entire subject circle. To fill the intersection of the subject and predicate circles, we need to tell TikZ to ignore everything that is outside the predicate circle, then fill the subject circle. This is done with the “\clip” command. This code shades the intersection of  <b>S</b> and  <b>P</b>:
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="orgd9d5d36">
\begin{tikzpicture}[thick]
  \begin{scope}
    \begin{scope} %Shade intersection of S and P
      \clip \pred;
      \fill[gray] \sub;
    \end{scope}

    \draw \sub;
    \draw \pred;
    \draw \mid;

    \draw (-2,-0) node {$S$};
    \draw (1,-4) node {$M$};
    \draw (4,0) node {$P$};
  \end{scope}
\end{tikzpicture}
</pre>
</div>
</div>
 <div id="outline-container-orgbd8f723" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="orgbd8f723">Universal Affirmations</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbd8f723">
 <p>
Shading everything that is one circle, but not in another is a bit trickier. It involves using something called the “even odd rule” in TikZ. Since I don’t quite understand how the rule works, this involved a bit of trial-and-error on my part. If there is a more efficient way, then please leave a comment. This code shades the portion of the subject circle that is not in the predicate circle:
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="org3445b7a">
\begin{tikzpicture}[thick]
  \begin{scope}[even odd rule]% Shade S without P
    \clip \pred (-1.5,-1.5) rectangle (1.5,1.5);
    \fill[gray] \sub;
  \end{scope}

  \draw \sub;
  \draw \pred;
  \draw \mid;

  \draw (-2,-0) node {$S$};
  \draw (1,-4) node {$M$};
  \draw (4,0) node {$P$};
\end{tikzpicture}
</pre>


 <p>
To shade  <b>S</b> without  <b>M</b>:
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="org060e870">
\begin{scope}[even odd rule]% Shade *S* without M
  \clip \mid (-1.5,-1.5) rectangle (1.5,1.5);
  \fill[gray] \sub;
\end{scope}
</pre>


 <p>
 <b>M</b> without  <b>S</b>:
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="org8a70021">
\begin{scope}[even odd rule]% Shade M without S
  \clip \sub (-0.5,-3.3) rectangle (2.5,0);
  \fill[gray] \mid;
\end{scope}
</pre>


 <p>
 <b>M</b> without  <b>P</b>:
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="org3abddf2">
\begin{scope}[even odd rule]% Shade M without P
  \clip \pred (-0.5,-3.3) rectangle (2.5,0);
  \fill[gray] \mid;
\end{scope}
</pre>

 <p>
 <b>P</b> without  <b>M</b>:
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="org1c0535a">
\begin{scope}[even odd rule]% Shade P without M
  \clip \mid (-0,-1.5) rectangle (3.5,1.5);
  \fill[gray] \pred;
\end{scope}
</pre>


 <p>
Finally, to shade  <b>P</b> without  <b>S</b>:
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="orgd731343">
\begin{scope}[even odd rule]% Shade P without S
  \clip \sub (0,-1.5) rectangle (3.5,1.5);

 <p>
Disamis is a good example of a universal affirmation with a particular affirmation.

 <figure id="orgb863ca6"> <img src="../images/posts/venn-disamis.png" alt="venn-disamis.png" width="75%"></img></figure></div>

It was made with this code:
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="org10516c2">

    \draw (1,-4) node {$B$};

 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6afcf15">
 <p>
TikZ graphics can be scaled easily with an option to the tikzpicture environment. This doubles the size of the picture:
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="orge1503e7">
\begin{tikzpicture}[thick,scale=2]
</pre>

 <p>
This reduces the size by half:
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="orged298ac">
\begin{tikzpicture}[thick,scale=.5]
</pre>

 <p>
Unfortunately, this won’t scale the text at the nodes, which will make the labels look ridiculously out of proportion. This can be fixed by adding an option to also scale the nodes. So, this produces a double-size image with proper labels:
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="orge42f535">
\begin{tikzpicture}[thick,scale=2, every node/.style={transform shape}]

  <title>The Fear of Risk</title>

</header> <p>
Gracious God,
</p>

 <p>
We live in fear <br></br>
of failure and <br></br>
disappointment, <br></br>
afraid that we <br></br>
might say or do <br></br>
the wrong thing.
</p>

 <p>
Paralyzed by risk, <br></br>
we simply do nothing <br></br>
and remain silent.
</p>

 <p>
But who am I, <br></br>
blind as I am, <br></br>
to judge what does <br></br>
or does not fail?
</p>

 <p>
Help me to trust in you, <br></br>
the one who makes all things <br></br>
work together for good, <br></br>
for, to, and through <br></br>
those who love you.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

Father,
</p>

 <p>
We live in a world <br></br>
with walls both <br></br>
visible and invisible; <br></br>
some protect us from harm, <br></br>
and others protect <br></br>
us from inconvenience, <br></br>
hearing only the voices <br></br>
that reinforce our fears.
</p>

 <p>
Open a window in the walls, <br></br>
so that we may hear the voice <br></br>
of the one who needs to be heard, <br></br>
who speaks in a still, small voice <br></br>
so often drowned out by our noisy lives.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

Almighty God, <br></br>
Lord of all, <br></br>
both the actual <br></br>
and the possible,
</p>

 <p>
I am indignant when <br></br>
labeled by others, <br></br>
put into a box <br></br>
built by those <br></br>
with no idea of <br></br>
who I really am.
</p>

 <p>
And so I define myself, <br></br>
enjoying my freedom <br></br>
to choose my own labels, <br></br>
but even I have no idea <br></br>
of what you will create <br></br>
with me in the future. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Lord, help me see that <br></br>
labels that are chosen <br></br>
are no less limiting than <br></br>
those that are imposed,
</p>

 <p>
And what I am is <br></br>
far less important <br></br>
than what I can be <br></br>
by the grace of God.

 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">May 08, 2016 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Gracious God,
</p>

 <p>
Thank you for the precious people <br></br>
who, quietly and humbly, have <br></br>
been the hands and feet of Jesus for us, <br></br>
who have celebrated our joys, <br></br>
wept in our sorrows, <br></br>
and sacrificed to help us <br></br>
become everything you <br></br>
have created us to be; <br></br>
each one a gift of love <br></br>
from your gracious hand. <br></br></p>

 <p>
May we also be a gift to others, <br></br>
who need to see your grace, especially <br></br>
the many women around the world <br></br>
whose voices have been silenced, <br></br>
some, sadly, by the church herself.
</p>

 <p>
Give us the grace <br></br>
to listen to those <br></br>
who are rarely heard, <br></br>
and to empower them <br></br>
to share their gifts, <br></br>
whatever they may be.

God of Pentecost,

I passed a church this morning that had this statement on the sign: “Indifference Not Hate.” I’m curious what is meant by this, is it supposed to be a statement of reassurance to the community? “It’s not that we hate you, we really just don’t care.” Would you rather be hated or simply ignored? At least hate is an acknowledgment of the existence and importance of the other person.

  <title>Reconciliation and Hope</title>

  <summary>Jun 01, 2016 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Reconciliation and Hope</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jun 01, 2016 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
I wrote this eight years ago, after President Obama’s election:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
The year that I was born, 1963, was marked by these significant events:
</p>

 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>In April, Martin Luther King was arrested and jailed in Birmingham.</li>
 <li>In May, “Bull” Connor, the Commissioner of Public Safety in Birmingham used police dogs and fire hoses on a demonstration in Birmingham.</li>
 <li>In June, Medgar Evers, the NAACP Field Secretary for Mississippi, was murdered outside his home.</li>
 <li>In August, Martin Luther King delivered his famous “I Have a Dream” speech at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.</li>
 <li>In September, four young girls were killed in the bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham.</li>
</ul> <p>
Tuesday, an African-American man was elected President of the United States.
</p>

 <p>
The country has certainly come far. European countries are generally viewed as far more progressive than the United States, but, as far as I can tell, no European country is even remotely close to being able to select a member of a minority racial group as head of government.
</p>

 <p>
That said, we still have a long ways to go before we can claim to have achieved racial reconciliation. On November 5, David Garland, President of Baylor University, issued a statement concerning recent incidents of racial conflict on Baylor’s campus. We cannot hope to achieve reconciliation in this country if we are not even able to achieve it in the Church. It is time for the Church to not only ask forgiveness for our past sins regarding slavery, but to recognize that failing to take action to create a better future is itself a sin.
</p>

 <p>
If nothing else, this week’s election is a sign of hope.
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
The events of the past eight years proved that progress requires more than simply hope.

Voice of Heaven,
</p>

 <p>
Words become thoughts, <br></br>
thoughts, beliefs, <br></br>
and beliefs, actions; <br></br>
and that which I <br></br>
once merely heard <br></br>
is soon that which I am.
</p>

 <p>
So, help me ignore <br></br>
the voices that inspire <br></br>
hatred and misery, <br></br>
distress and malice, <br></br>
selfishness and fear,
</p>

 <p>
May I again hear the <br></br>
words of love and joy, <br></br>
peace and kindness, <br></br>
generosity and hope;
</p>

 <p>
And by hearing, <br></br>
learn to speak, <br></br>
and by speaking, <br></br>
learn to sing with the <br></br>
Father, Son, and Spirit.
</p>

 <p>
Three distinct voices, <br></br>
in one beautiful song.

  <title>Formatting Poetry</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jun 08, 2016 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Formatting Poetry</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jun 08, 2016 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
I have been browsing  <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> themes lately,
and found a very nice theme for academics, the  <a href="http://elotroalex.github.io/ed/documentation/#bibliographies">Ed. Theme</a>. Its main purpose seems to be publishing classic texts and poetry on the web, and it includes some very handy tools.
</p>

 <p>
Getting indentation right is a problem with poetry on the web. For example, consider these lines from “The Code—Heroics” by Robert Frost.
</p>

 <p>
Here is the Markdown source:
</p>


 <pre class="example" id="orga05d767">
What was there wrong?
		     Something you said just now.
What did I say?
	       About our taking pains.


Even though it contains the proper indentation, it renders like this:

What was there wrong?
		     Something you said just now.
What did I say?
	       About our taking pains.
</pre>

 <p>
Now, stripping out extra whitespace is generally a good thing, but I don’t want it to happen with poetry. With help from the CSS in the .Ed theme, I can get the indentation right.
</p>


 <pre class="example" id="org469f23c">
- What was there wrong?
- {:.indent-10}Something you said just now.
- What did I say?
- {:.indent-6}About our taking pains.
{:.poetry}
</pre>


 <p>
Ed. sets poetry as an unordered list, with each line as a list item. List style is set to “none” and the indented lines contain an “indent-x” attribute. This produces these properly indented lines:
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="orga875019">
- What was there wrong?
- {:.indent-10}Something you said just now.
- What did I say?
- {:.indent-65}About our taking pains.
{:.poetry}
</pre>

 <p>
Ed. also contains formatting tools for bibliographies. It’s built on  <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon">Lanyon</a>, the theme that I use, so it was easy for me to just add the CSS that I wanted to my existing site.
</p>

Here is my attempt at pull quotes in the Lanyon/Poole theme for Jekyll:
</p>


 <pre class="example" id="org1d47b80">
.pquote {
    float: right;
    width: 15rem;
    color: #979797;
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    line-height: 1.8rem;
    font-style: italic;
    padding: 1rem;
	quotes: "\201C""\201D""\2018""\2019";
}
</pre>

 <p>
I just learned that Kramdown makes it easy to specify classes and attributes. So, this produces the pull quote:
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="org4eaf339">
> This is some quoted text.
{:.pquote}
</pre>


 <p>
It is easy to add quotation marks automatically, using the “before” and “after” class selectors. I decided not to do this for the sake of flexibility.

  <title>Prayer for Orlando</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Prayer for Orlando</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jun 12, 2016 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Lord Jesus,
</p>

 <p>
On this day that we mourn <br></br>
the loss of so many whom you love, <br></br>
it is tempting to pray <br></br>
that you would return <br></br>
and take us from this world.
</p>

 <p>
Tempting, because it shifts <br></br>
the burden to you, <br></br>
leaving nothing for us <br></br>
but escape, evasion, and excuse.
</p>

 <p>
Yet you are not the God who excuses, <br></br>
but the God who redeems; <br></br>
not the God of escape, <br></br>
but the God of the cross.
</p>

 <p>
You are not a passive God, <br></br>
and neither should we <br></br>
be a passive people.
</p>

 <p>
So we pray, <br></br>
not because it is <br></br>
the only thing we can do, <br></br>
but because it is <br></br>
the first thing.
</p>

 <p>
For what should follow, <br></br>
give us the wisdom to know it; <br></br>
grant us the courage to do it.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

On average, twenty-two veterans commit suicide every day.
</p>

 <p>
God of peace,
</p>

 <p>
We pray for those who <br></br>
bear the scars of war, <br></br>
both visible and invisible, <br></br>
for wounds that cannot be seen <br></br>
are no less painful to bear, <br></br>
and peace is but a distant dream <br></br>
when the war is within one’s own soul.
</p>

 <p>
Give them the courage to speak, <br></br>
and give us to grace to listen.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>Emacs on the iPad</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jun 23, 2016 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Emacs on the iPad</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jun 23, 2016 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
The iPad Pro has more people considering using the iPad for production, not just for entertainment. I have long been jealous of those who could use an iPad for most of their work, especially now, as iPad displays get bigger and nicer. I would love to be able to throw an iPad and keyboard into a small bag and be able to use the same tool for both reading and writing.
</p>

 <p>
Unfortunately, though, two things have kept me from being able to easily do that. First, I do almost of all my work in Emacs, and I’m afraid that Apple would never allow Emacs on the iPad. Second, except for blog posts, almost everything I write eventually becomes a LaTeX document that is compiled into a PDF.
</p>

 <p>
I’m sure that most people wouldn’t be troubled at all by either of these problems. My projects usually begin as Markdown files, and there are some decent Markdown editors on iOS. Most of these are limited to using one subfolder in Dropbox, and I have a folder for each course, writing project, my website, etc. A larger problem is that Emacs becomes a finely tuned, personal tool for a user. With one keystroke, I can renumber ordered lists, insert a reference from my bibliography database, commit changes to a git repository, and many other things. Once this has become ingrained, it is very difficult to go to anything else. I can write LaTeX on the iPad, but I can’t compile. That still has to be done on another machine. So, while others are carrying their nice, light tablets, I’ve been schlepping a MacBook Pro.
</p>

 <p>
A few days ago, I noticed that  <a href="http://www.digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean</a> has a remote server plan with 20 GB of solid state storage for five dollars a month. It only has 512 MB of memory, but that seems to be plenty for Emacs and Vim. I signed up, started a machine, and installed Ubuntu. I installed Emacs, Vim, Pandoc, and LaTeX. I changed the shell to the fish shell, and moved all of my configuration files. Since the configuration files are all on Github, moving them to the machine was simple.
</p>

 <p>
So, the good news is that I’m now writing this in Emacs on the iPad. The bad news is, since I had given up being able to use the iPad to write, I traded in my larger iPad for an iPad mini. Now, I really will be looking longingly at those iPad Pros I see at Starbucks.

  <title>Prayer for the Nation</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jul 09, 2016 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Prayer for the Nation</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jul 09, 2016 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Eternal God, you whose image lies in the hearts of all people, <br></br>
Hear our prayer, as we pray for our nation.
</p>

 <p>
Help us to remember that you love all with your great love, <br></br>
that all faith is an attempt to respond to you, <br></br>
and that the desires of other hearts are known by you, <br></br>
just as our desires are known.
 <br></br>
Lead us to use what you have given us <br></br>
for freedom, justice, and equality; <br></br>
Not only for our own sake, <br></br>
but for those to whom these things have been denied.
</p>

 <p>
In our pride, teach us humility; <br></br>
In our strength, teach us grace; <br></br>
In our callousness, teach us compassion; <br></br>
In our riches, teach us generosity, <br></br>
In our ignorance, give us wisdom; <br></br>
In our fear, give us courage; <br></br>
In our anxiety, give us peace.
</p>

 <p>
May we be a source of love in the midst of hatred, <br></br>
And an instrument of peace in the midst of conflict. <br></br>
We pray these things in the name of the most high, <br></br>
The source of all that is good, holy, and true.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>Automating Jekyll with Fish</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jul 12, 2016 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Automating Jekyll with Fish</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jul 12, 2016 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
 <a href="2016-06-23-emacs-on-the-ipad.html">Last month</a>, I wrote about my experiment with iOS and a remote server from
 <a href="http://wwww.digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean</a>. It’s working very well, but Emacs can feel a bit sluggish at times, served up remotely over a crowded public wi-fi network. Vim is speedy, and since I use Evil on Emacs, it’s not too painful to switch occasionally. Any pain comes from the loss of the automation with all of those Emacs functions I’ve written and collected over the years.
</p>

 <p>
I thought about writing some scripts in Elisp, but settled on functions in the  <a href="http://fishshell.com/">Fish</a> Shell. The first function
creates an appropriately named Markdown file with YAML front-matter. The important parts come from  <a href="https://gist.github.com/marcransome/6096005">Marc Ransome</a>:
</p>


 <pre class="example" id="org1bae711">
function draft -d "Open default editor with date prepended filename and specified title for jekyll posts."

cd ~/Dropbox/blog-drafts

# Create file
  set title (date +"%Y-%m-%d")

  switch (count $argv)
    case 0
      echo "No post title was specified."
      return 1
    case 1
      set lower_arg (echo $argv[1] | tr A-Z a-z)
      set title $title-$lower_arg.md
    case \*
      for arg in $argv
	set lower_arg (echo $arg | tr A-Z a-z)
	set title $title-$lower_arg
      end
      set title $title.md
  end

# Append YAML
echo "---" >> $title
echo "layout: post" >> $title
echo "title: " $argv >> $title
echo "tags:" >> $title
echo "- " >> $title
echo "comments: true" >> $title
echo "date:" (date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") >> $title
echo "---" >> $title

# Open file in VIM
  EDITOR $title
end
</pre>

 <p>
The other two functions were very simple – one to move a completed draft to the _posts folder, and another to commit the new post and push to Github with the imaginative commit message, “New post”:
</p>


 <pre class="example" id="orge9bd11f">
function post
   mv $argv ~/Sites/rlridenour.github.io/_posts
end

function publish
 cd ~/Sites/rlridenour.github.io
 git add .
 git commit -m "New post."
 git push
end
</pre>

God of compassion,
</p>

 <p>
In these weeks of violence and tragedy, <br></br>
we have mourned with those who grieve, <br></br>
cried with those who weep, <br></br>
sat in silence with those in pain, <br></br>
and protested with those who suffer injustice.
</p>

 <p>
But what should never happen even once <br></br>
seems to happen over and over again, <br></br>
until we are left with nothing <br></br>
but bloodshot eyes and numb hearts.
</p>

 <p>
Banish our fears, restore our hope, <br></br>
and give us a vision of what can be, <br></br>
if we were to give our neighbor <br></br>
the same grace that you have given us.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>Should the Church Bear the Welfare Burden?</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jul 31, 2016 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Should the Church Bear the Welfare Burden?</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jul 31, 2016 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
I should have rather asked if the church  <i>alone</i> should bear the burden of providing welfare. There is no doubt that the church, myself included, should bear more of the burden of caring for the poor, for that is just one of the many sacrificial things Jesus calls us to do. The church, though, cannot bear the welfare burden as it is today. Ron Sider, in  <i>Just Generosity: A New Vision for Overcoming Poverty in America</i>, estimates that shouldering just the cost of Medicaid would cost each Christian congregation approximately one-half million dollars per year. Note that this includes  <i>each</i> congregation, including exceptionally large churches that may well be able to afford the cost, but the median size of a Christian congregation in America is now 75 regular participants. <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> So, a family of four in the median-sized congregation would have to shoulder a burden of nearly 27,000 dollars, simply to provide the services now provided by Medicaid. One can only guess at the cost of providing the full level of social services now provided by the government.
</p>

 <p>
This does not mean that the church should not be developing creative ways of caring for those that Jesus and the prophets called “the least of these.” It does mean, though, that the church taking on more of a burden <sup> <a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> does not relieve the state, nor the rest of the country, from sharing that burden. In Psalm 72, a prayer for guidance for the king, Scripture describes God’s hope for the one who leads the state: “May he defend the cause of the poor of the people, give deliverance to the needy, and crush the oppressor.” To allow the state to shirk its responsibility for caring the poor means that the state will no longer fulfill its God-given role of crushing the oppressor, but instead allows the state to become the oppressor — surely not something to which a government of the people should aspire.

  <title>A Wedding Prayer and Blessing</title>

  <summary>Aug 07, 2016 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">A Wedding Prayer and Blessing</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Aug 07, 2016 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
I officiated a wedding for a former student and dear friend yesterday. Here is the prayer and blessing from the ceremony:
</p>

 <p>
God of grace, hear our prayer,
</p>

 <p>
We give thanks for this day, for we need it desperately. <br></br>
The world inundates us with messages of <br></br>
helplessness and hopelessness, emptiness and despair, <br></br>
until we are tempted to feel that all is lost. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Then we come to this place, <br></br>
and we find that there is still hope, <br></br>
for the love that spoke the world into being <br></br>
has drawn these two people together, <br></br>
so that they may create their own world, <br></br>
a life together, <br></br>
marked by beauty, <br></br>
dedicated to peace, <br></br>
and surrounded by love.
</p>

 <p>
Protect, guide, and bless them in their marriage. <br></br>
Surround us all with your love, now and always.
</p>

 <p>
Now, may the slanting rays of the sun <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> <br></br>
light the path before you, <br></br>
as the love of God surrounds you, <br></br>
to guide you on this journey together. <br></br>
May God guard your hearts <br></br>
from anything that might separate you, <br></br>
and shelter you in his love, forever.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

</header> <p>
This is the benediction from a funeral service that I officiated today:
</p>

 <p>
In our blindness, <br></br>
may the light of God <br></br>
keep us from stumbling.
</p>

 <p>
In our sorrow, <br></br>
may the hand of God <br></br>
dry our tears.
</p>

 <p>
In our questions, <br></br>
may the grace of God <br></br>
be enough, until that day <br></br>
that we know fully, <br></br>
even as we are fully known.
</p>

 <p>
Now, may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, <br></br>
the love of the Father, <br></br>
and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit <br></br>
be with you all, <br></br>
now and forever.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Aug 27, 2016 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Thank you for the gift of friends, <br></br>
those who are near, <br></br>
and those who are far; <br></br>
those still with us, <br></br>
and those who await us <br></br>

that there is no distance, <br></br>

neither this life, nor the next, <br></br>
that cannot be crossed.
</p>

 <p>
For nothing can separate us <br></br>
from the love of God, <br></br>
and by that same love, <br></br>
we are connected to each other.

22 Shenanigans is an organization dedicated to reducing the number of suicides among veterans. Here is the benediction from the sermon I preached at an event they held on Labor Day weekend.
</p>


 <p>
Go now, follow where Christ calls you <br></br>
and proclaim the message God gives you.  <br></br>
Don’t be distracted by the concerns of the world, <br></br>
but stay focused on the hope that is within you.
</p>

 <p>
May the Father be your strength and confidence; <br></br>
May Christ Jesus give you courage for his mission; <br></br>
And may the Spirit speak when your words fail.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

I’m sitting in the USO at the Portland airport with some time to write the prayer for the week. The week of 9/11 is always a time of reflection for me. In past years, I’ve generally thought about the cost to military families, compared to a country that mostly feels inconvenienced at the airport. This year, I thought instead about the wonderful friends I made during two deployments. Although I do wish that the conflict had never happened, those friends are gifts from God that I will always cherish.
</p>

 <p>
This week’s prayer:
</p>

 <p>
Thank you for <br></br>
the precious ones <br></br>
who walk through <br></br>
the valleys with us, <br></br>
surrounding us <br></br>
with your love, <br></br>
and reminding us <br></br>
that your grace can <br></br>
redeem every moment.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>The Ballad of Mitch Randall</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Sep 22, 2016 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">The Ballad of Mitch Randall</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Sep 22, 2016 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
(Sung to the tune of “John Henry”)
</p>

 <p>
When Mitch Randall was a little baby, <br></br>
sitting on his father’s knee. <br></br>
He tied a ribbon on his finger, <br></br>
and he held it in the air. <br></br>
Said, this bow tie’s gonna be the death of me, Lord, Lord <br></br>
This bow tie’s gonna be the death of me.
</p>

 <p>
When Mitch Randall was just a little boy, <br></br>
his parents noticed that he was an unusual child. <br></br>
When other kids would want cookies and milk, <br></br>
all Mitch wanted was a piece of silk.
</p>

 <p>
He’d tie that silk to anything he could reach, <br></br>
the table leg, <br></br>
the chair leg, <br></br>
the dog’s leg, <br></br>
his father’s leg.
</p>

 <p>
Nice neat bows, <br></br>
straight, <br></br>
even on both sides.
</p>

 <p>
And then one day,
 <br></br>
He was standing in front of the mirror, <br></br>
seeing what he could see. <br></br>
He tied that piece of ribbon right around his neck, and said, <br></br>
this is the look for me, Lord, Lord. <br></br>
This is the look for me.
 <br></br>
So, he started wearing a bow tie to church. <br></br>
Everybody thought it was cute. <br></br>
Then he wore it to school. <br></br>
That was not so cute. <br></br>
When he started wearing it with his baseball uniform, <br></br>
everybody thought it was just a little weird.
</p>


 <p>
When the other kids started to tease him <br></br>
His dad decided to have a talk. <br></br>
He said, son, <br></br>
that may be the look down in Texas, Austin, that is, <br></br>
but this is Oklahoma, 1975. <br></br>
It’s just not that progressive a state. <br></br>
But here’s what I want you to remember:
 <br></br>
Don’t let them make fun of your bow tie, <br></br>
You gotta be who you gotta be. <br></br>
So, when you wear a bow tie round your neck, <br></br>
You gotta wear it with your head held high, Lord, Lord. <br></br>
Wear it with your head held high.
 <br></br>
Then he went off to college. <br></br>
As it was for many young people, <br></br>
college was a place for experimenting, <br></br>
pushing the envelope, <br></br>
things you wouldn’t necessarily tell your parents about, <br></br>
getting wild…
</p>

 <p>
Striped bow ties, <br></br>
plaids, <br></br>
polka dots, <br></br>
paisleys, <br></br>
there were parts of town where you could slip a man five bucks <br></br>
and he’d give you a floral pattern tie.
</p>

 <p>
Seminary was tough, though, <br></br>
cause this was fort worth, <br></br>
where they wore their hair short, <br></br>
And their ties long. <br></br>
He felt alone, <br></br>
nobody understood. <br></br>
But then one day, <br></br>
in a course on religion and the state, <br></br>
he learned about the Baptist Joint Committee, <br></br>
with men like James Dunn and Brent Walker, <br></br>
who wore their bow ties in the service of the Lord.
</p>

 <p>
And, hallelujah, Mitch had found his calling!
 <br></br>
When he saw the men with the bow ties, <br></br>
He said, you know I got to go, <br></br>
Down to Washington DC, to fight for liberty, <br></br>
I gotta be on the BJC, Lord, Lord. <br></br>
I gotta be on the BJC.
 <br></br>
Then he came to NorthHaven. <br></br>
Growing up had been tough in northeastern Oklahoma, <br></br>
but Norman was different. <br></br>
There were liberals, <br></br>
hippies, <br></br>
Democrats, <br></br>
people who wouldn’t look twice at a man with a bow tie.
</p>

 <p>
And the people of NorthHaven admired his skill. <br></br>
Even on both sides, <br></br>
nice dimple in the center. <br></br>
Straight, not crooked, <br></br>
good-looking ties.
</p>

 <p>
Everything was good, until…
 <br></br>
In one day, walked Bryan Partridge, <br></br>
With a smile on his face. <br></br>
The bow tie that we saw, was completely without flaw. <br></br>
And the challenge had been thrown down, Lord, Lord. <br></br>
The challenge had been thrown down.
</p>

 <p>
Yes, my friends, it was the beginning of the end. <br></br>
The old ways were dying, <br></br>
passing away before a new generation. <br></br>
The age of the clip-on had come.
</p>

 <p>
And Mitch Randall said to Bryan Partridge, <br></br>
I don’t care if my tie is a wreck. <br></br>
Before I put that clip-on on my shirt, <br></br>
I’ll die with a bow tie round my neck, Lord, Lord. <br></br>
I’ll die with a bow tie round my neck.
</p>

 <p>
They decided to have a contest. <br></br>
Whoever could put on the most ties in an hour <br></br>
would be the NorthHaven champion. <br></br>
It was old-school vs. the young upstart.
</p>

 <p>
And so, Mitch Randall, he started tying. <br></br>
His fingers went round and round. <br></br>
But he couldn’t make it last, <br></br>
cause the clip-on was so fast. <br></br>
It left poor Mitch on the ground, Lord, Lord. <br></br>
It left poor Mitch on the ground.
</p>

 <p>
He couldn’t keep up the pace <br></br>
With those small, delicate ties. <br></br>
He needed something bigger, easier to grasp. <br></br>
So, he reached for the secret weapon, <br></br>
The Barnum and Bailey special.
</p>

 <p>
But when he wrapped that clown tie around his neck, <br></br>
Disaster struck.
</p>

 <p>
Then his tie got caught in the shredder, <br></br>
and it pulled his head straight down. <br></br>
And the next thing that we knew, <br></br>
it looked like he was through. <br></br>
We’d have to plant poor Mitch in the ground, Lord, Lord. <br></br>
We’d have to plant poor Mitch in the ground.
</p>

 <p>
Nobody knew what to do. <br></br>
One person screamed. <br></br>
Another person laughed. <br></br>
(One of those was Cheryl, another was Kim. I’ll let you decide which was which.) <br></br>
And then Sheri walked into the room. <br></br>
she muttered something about boys and their foolishness, <br></br>
and cut that bow tie clean in half with a pair of scissors.
</p>

 <p>
Then Mitch Randall said to Bryan Partridge, <br></br>
Lord knows, I’ve been a fool. <br></br>
Well, before I die with a bow tie round my neck, <br></br>
I’m gonna get me clip-on too, Lord, Lord. <br></br>
I’m gonna get me clip-on too.
</p>

Creator God,
</p>

 <p>
I gaze out from my fortress, <br></br>
and see a dangerous, hostile place, <br></br>
with dangers on all sides, <br></br>
forcing me to defend my territory <br></br>
against my many enemies.
</p>

 <p>
Sometimes, I see a cold, unfeeling place, <br></br>
that demands that I care only for myself, <br></br>
since no one else will care for me.
</p>

 <p>
Tell me what I would see, Lord, <br></br>
if only I could replace these <br></br>
grimy panes of doubt and fear, <br></br>
and see your creation through <br></br>
the clear windows of hope and love.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>Race, Police Shooting, and Probability</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Oct 01, 2016 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Race, Police Shooting, and Probability</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Oct 01, 2016 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
I just read a Facebook comment by someone who was apparently downplaying the Black Lives Matter movement by pointing out that the police shoot more white Americans than black Americans. 
</p>

 <p>
True, but it’s a classic error in statistical reasoning. The vast majority of drivers involved in accidents are sober, but it doesn’t follow that one is more likely to have an accident if one is sober than if drunk. That is, the probability that a person was drunk given that he was in an accident is very low, but the probability that someone will be in an accident given that he is drunk is very high.
</p>

 <p>
Whites comprise 62% of the population, while African-Americans are only 13%. Of people killed by police officers, 49% are white and 24% are black. Since Jan 1, 2015, roughly 1,500 people have been shot and killed by police in the United States. <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> This tells us that a person who has been killed by police is twice as likely to be white than black, exactly as the commenter stated. As is often the case with statistics, though, what we’re given is not what we want to know, but it can be used to derive what we want to know.
</p>

 <p>
Let \(W\) be white, \(B\) be black, and \(K\) be killed by police. The probability that someone is white if they are killed by police, \(\Pr (W \vert K)\), is 0.49. The probability that someone is black if they are killed by police, \(\Pr (B \vert K)\), is 0.24. What we need to know, though, is the probability that someone will be killed by police given their race. To do this, we need to use Bayes’ theorem.
</p>

 <p>
\[ \Pr (K \vert R) = \Pr (K) \times \frac{\Pr (R \vert K)}{\Pr (R)}\]
</p>

 <p>
Since \(\Pr(K)\) is the same for both whites and blacks, we can safely ignore it when determining how much more likely a person is to be killed given that their race. We simply need to compare \(\frac{\Pr (W \vert K)}{\Pr (W)}\) to \(\frac{\Pr (B) \vert (K)}{\Pr (B)}\).
</p>

 <p>
\[\frac{\Pr (W \vert K)}{\Pr (W)} = \frac{0.49}{0.62} = 0.79\]
</p>

 <p>
On the other hand,
</p>

 <p>
\[\frac{\Pr (B \vert K)}{\Pr (B)} = \frac{0.24}{0.13} = 1.84\]
</p>

 <p>
That is, a person that is an African-American is 2.34 times more likely to be killed by police than a White-American.
</p>

 <p>
All lives do indeed, objectively, equally matter. Unfortunately, though, we must confess that America has a history of black lives not mattering subjectively to those who have held social power. When a truth has been ignored, even suppressed, for so long, it must be emphasized to gain its rightful standing in our social reality. To do otherwise, that is to simply say “All lives matter,” is to maintain an unjust status quo that serves the interests of some, but not all Americans.
</p>

 <p>
 <b>UPDATE (October  2, 2016)</b>: I want to be careful to note what I am arguing here, and more importantly what I am  <i>not</i> arguing. I am merely pointing out the fairly trivial claim that \(\Pr(A \vert B)\) does not necessarily equal \( \Pr(B \vert A) \), and, in this case, actually does not.
</p>

 <p>
I am not accusing the police of being racist, and I have not endeavored to show that anyone has been unjustly shot. I am simply showing that, even though more white Americans are killed by police, black Americans are more likely to be killed by police. There are many possible explanations for this, ranging from racial bias in the police force to high rates of violent crime in predominately African-American communities. There are significant studies that conclude that the former is more likely than the latter to be the correct explanation, but that will have to wait for another post.

  <title>The Uselessness of Political Fact-Checking</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">The Uselessness of Political Fact-Checking</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Oct 20, 2016 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
I’ve decided that political fact-checking is largely useless. Either people completely ignore the work of fact-checkers, or the fact-checkers ignore the relevant facts. Today, I saw a claim that Clinton had leaked classified information about the nuclear response window. What was curious was that the post included a link to a  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/clinton-four-minute-nuclear/">snopes.com</a> story explaining that the supposed leak was not classified, but was already public information. The person evidently failed to read the very story to which they had linked. <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup></p>

 <p>
Now, I’m seeing many claims that only 5.7% of Clinton Foundation donations go to charity. <sup> <a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> Unlike the claim about the classified leak, this is at least partly true. That is indeed the percentage that is given by the Foundation to other organizations that do charitable work. What it ignores is that most of the money is kept by the Foundation for the charitable work that it does directly. The Foundation spends 12% on overhead costs, compared to the average charity which spends nearly 37% <sup> <a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>. This earns the Clinton Foundation an “A” rating by the American Institute of Philanthropy’s  <a href="https://www.charitywatch.org/ratings-and-metrics/bill-hillary-chelsea-clinton-foundation/478">Charity Watch</a>. That doesn’t mean that Clinton’s claim that 90% of the Foundation’s money goes to charitable causes and work is true, though. According to Charity Watch, it’s only 88%. I suppose one could criticize Clinton for rounding up from 88% to 90%. That strikes me as a bit petty, but at least it would be true.

  <title>Confirmation Bias and the Clinton Foundation</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Oct 21, 2016 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Confirmation Bias and the Clinton Foundation</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Oct 21, 2016 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Yesterday, I showed that claiming that only 5.7% of Clinton Foundation donations goes to charity is essentially false. Although that is indeed the percentage that goes to other charitable organizations, it ignores the fact that the Clinton Foundation is itself a public charity, unlike the Trump Foundation, which is a private foundation.
</p>

 <p>
In response, a friend said that, although my claim was technically true, the majority of Clinton Foundation money goes back to the Clintons through the its two largest program expenditures, the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) and the Clinton Presidential Library. 
</p>

 <p>
It is true that CGI and the Library are two of the largest program expenditures of the Clinton Foundation, ranking second and third, respectively. They are not even remotely close to the majority of expenditures, however. Even together, they account for, at most, only 18% of the Foundation’s annual expenditures. <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup></p>

 <p>
Now, I’m not defending the spending of the Clinton Foundation. <sup> <a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> I have no idea how effective its charitable work is. The point is that too many people (myself included, to be honest) simply share, retweet, or repost anything that is consistent with our own biases without checking the material for accuracy, even when verification would be relatively simple. This is called confirmation bias, something that we all must take care to minimize. Remember Reagan’s dictum, “Trust, but verify.” <sup> <a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup></p>

The annual reports and audited financial statements of the  <a href="https://www.clintonfoundation.org/about/annual-financial-reports">Clinton Foundation</a> show that CGI and the Library combined accounted for 14.8% to 18% of program expenditures over the last three years.

God of Grace,

 <p>
When Jesus was offered <br></br>

or to be silent,

He chose silence.

A prayer for the days preceding the election:
</p>

 <p>
God of comfort,
</p>

 <p>
No matter the result, <br></br>
Half of us will find <br></br>
That the thing we fear <br></br>
Will have come true.
</p>

 <p>
Calm our fears, <br></br>
And restore our faith.
</p>

 <p>
Cleanse our despair, <br></br>
And give us hope.
</p>

 <p>
Banish our anger, <br></br>
And renew our love.
</p>

 <p>
Remind us once again <br></br>
That the Spirit who unites us <br></br>
Is greater than anything <br></br>
That could ever divide us.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

Prayer for All Saints Day
</p>

 <p>
Lord,
</p>

 <p>
We search for heroes <br></br>
among the rich, powerful, <br></br>
strong and proud — <br></br>
those who look more <br></br>
like the crucifiers <br></br>
than the crucified. <br></br></p>

 <p>
But on this day, <br></br>
we give thanks <br></br>
for those for whom <br></br>
loving is more important <br></br>
than being loved, <br></br>
and faithfulness more <br></br>
dear than fame. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Not our idols, <br></br>
instead, your saints. <br></br></p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>After the Election — Love</title>

  <summary>Nov 10, 2016 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">After the Election — Love</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Nov 10, 2016 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
There are circumstances during which my failure becomes clearly evident, and the events of the past few days have given me needed opportunity to reflect on that failure.
</p>

 <p>
God’s commandment is to love — a commandment given not to an abstract entity such as government or the church, but a commandment given to me.
</p>

 <p>
Even more, God commanded me to love my neighbor — not the world or humanity, but my neighbor, the one who weeps in fear and pain, the one who offends me, the one with whom I disagree, and the one of whom I take no notice.
</p>

 <p>
May God have mercy on me, a sinner.
</p>

 <p>
God who sustains us,
</p>

 <p>
If we are to rejoice together, <br></br>
may we taste the strength <br></br>
of your justice and peace. <br></br></p>

 <p>
If we are to suffer together, <br></br>
may we drink deeply <br></br>
from your sacred tears. <br></br></p>

 <p>
If we are to live together, <br></br>
may we feast on your love, <br></br>
knowing that there is one rule <br></br>
at the table of the Lord:
</p>

 <p>
“Little children, love one another.”
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>On Christian Unity</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Nov 23, 2016 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">On Christian Unity</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Nov 23, 2016 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Comedian Emo Phillips is credited with writing this classic – voted in a recent contest as the best religious joke of all time.
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
Once I saw this guy on a bridge about to jump. I said, “Don’t do it!” He said, “Nobody loves me.” I said, “God loves you. Do you believe in God?”
</p>

 <p>
He said, “Yes.” I said, “Are you a Christian or a Jew?” He said, “A Christian.” I said, “Me, too! Protestant or Catholic?” He said, “Protestant.” I said, “Me, too! What denomination?” He said, “Baptist.” I said, “Me, too! Northern Baptist or Southern Baptist?” He said, “Northern Baptist.” I said, “Me, too! Northern Conservative Baptist or Northern Liberal Baptist?”
</p>

 <p>
He said, “Northern Conservative Baptist.” I said, “Me, too! Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region, or Northern Conservative Baptist Eastern Region?” He said, “Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region.” I said, “Me, too!”
</p>

 <p>
Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region Council of 1879, or Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region Council of 1912?“ He said, ”Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region Council of 1912.“ I said, ”Die, heretic!" And I pushed him over.
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
It’s a funny joke, and like most good jokes, it captures something true, in this case disturbingly true, about our history as Christians. Today, according to  <i>Oxford’s World Christian Encyclopedia</i>, there are over 33,000 Christian denominations in the world. This is partly a sign of healthy diversity, but it’s also a sign of some deeply unhealthy divisions.
</p>

 <p>
The first three verses of Ephesians 4 <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> contain this beautiful plea for Christian unity:
</p>

 <p>
Therefore, as a prisoner for the Lord, I encourage you to live as people worthy of the call you received from God. Conduct yourselves with all humility, gentleness, and patience. Accept each other with love, and make an effort to preserve the unity of the Spirit with the peace that ties you together. (Eph. 4:1-3)
</p>

 <p>
Eight verses later, Paul speaks of another kind of unity that Paul calls unity of faith:
</p>

 <p>
He gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers. His purpose was to equip God’s people for the work of serving and building up the body of Christ until we all reach the unity of faith and knowledge of God’s Son. (Eph. 4:11-13a)
</p>

 <p>
The unity of the Spirit is something that we are to work towards now, while unity of faith and knowledge appears to be eschatological — something that we will have in the end. We continue to exclude more and more people from our various groups, acting as if cooperation and fellowship require doctrinal unity. Paul’s charge to preserve the unity of Spirit assumes disagreement, otherwise there is no need to urge patience. <sup> <a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup></p>

 <p>
When we exclude, we show pride, impatience, and hardness of spirit, not the humility, gentleness, and patience of Paul’s mandate. In the end, we sacrifice the thing that Paul urges us to protect, for the sake of something that we cannot yet have. We either demonstrate intolerance, or, at best, show tolerance from a distance. Neither is the love that Christ commanded.

  <title>Gratitude Over Despair</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Gratitude Over Despair</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Nov 24, 2016 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
This prayer is from 2014, but somehow seems fitting again this year:
</p>

 <p>
Gracious God,
</p>

 <p>
In the events of this year, <br></br>
we see how fragile our lives truly are.
</p>

 <p>
Daily, we are faced with a choice <br></br>
to be people who live in cynicism and despair, <br></br>
or people who live in gratitude and thanksgiving.
</p>

 <p>
On this day, we choose gratitude over despair, <br></br>
and lift our hearts in thanksgiving to you, <br></br>
the one who is the source of all good things.
</p>

 <p>
Thank you <br></br>
for family and friends, <br></br>
for life and for love, <br></br>
and for the beauty that we would see <br></br>
if we would just open our eyes to you.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Dec 03, 2016 00:00</p>

NPR has a fascinating, if not troubling,  <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/11/23/503146770/npr-finds-the-head-of-a-covert-fake-news-operation-in-the-suburbs">interview</a> with a creator of various fake news sites that began to profilerate during the 2016 presidential election. This part of the interview was particularly telling:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
Well, this isn’t just a Trump-supporter problem. This is a right-wing issue. Sarah Palin’s famous blasting of the lamestream media is kind of record and testament to the rise of these kinds of people. The post-fact era is what I would refer to it as. This isn’t something that started with Trump. This is something that’s been in the works for a while. His whole campaign was this thing of discrediting mainstream media sources, which is one of those dog whistles to his supporters. When we were coming up with headlines it’s always kind of about the red meat. Trump really got into the red meat. He knew who his base was. He knew how to feed them a constant diet of this red meat.
</p>

 <p>
We’ve tried to do similar things to liberals. It just has never worked, it never takes off. You’ll get debunked within the first two comments and then the whole thing just kind of fizzles out.
</p>

Love left its throne, <br></br>

To walk, <br></br>

  <title>The Offensive Jesus</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Dec 13, 2016 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">The Offensive Jesus</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Dec 13, 2016 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
The Gospel text for the third Sunday of Advent in year A is Matthew 11:2-11, which, on the surface, seems like an odd choice for the Christmas season, especially for a day known as the “Sunday of joy.” It opens with what is apparently some doubt on the part of John the Baptist: “When John heard in prison what the Messiah was doing, he sent word by his disciples and said to him, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or are we to wait for another?’”
</p>

 <p>
The third chapter of Matthew records John speaking of the wrath to come and the unquenchable fire that will be used to burn the chaff. It appears that the messiah that John got did not look much like the messiah that John expected. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Too often, our celebration of Christmas shows that we, like John, also would prefer another messiah. To paraphrase Ricky Bobby in Talladega Nights, we like the Christmas Jesus best – the sweet, calm, beautiful, inoffensive, unchallenging, non-threatening Jesus of the carol “Silent Night.” This Jesus doesn’t call us to follow him, for he never leaves the manger, and certainly doesn’t go to the cross. We are like John Updike’s title character in  <i>Rabbit, Run</i>, who “…has no taste for the dark, tangled, visceral aspect of Christianity, the going through quality of it, the passage into death and suffering that redeems and inverts these things.”
</p>

 <p>
The babe born in Bethlehem, though, would soon become the one who offended religious sensibilities and challenged the power structures of the day. In his own words, he came to preach good news to the poor and to liberate the oppressed. He was perceived by the Romans to be such a political threat that he was executed on a cross. It could very well be the case that the only person in Matthew’s birth narrative to truly understand the implications of the event was Herod.
</p>

 <p>
We feel happy at the manger, but joy is found on the road beyond — even if that road leads to the cross. So, as we search for meaning this Christmas season, may we look beyond the birth narratives to consider the Christ-hymn of Philippians 2; that this Jesus
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
…who, though he was in the form of God, <br></br>
did not regard equality with God <br></br>
as something to be exploited, <br></br>
but emptied himself, <br></br>
taking the form of a slave, <br></br>
being born in human likeness. <br></br>
And being found in human form, <br></br>
he humbled himself <br></br>
and became obedient to the point of death — <br></br>
even death on a cross. <br></br></p>
</blockquote>



 <p>
Prayer:
</p>

 <p>
May I come to Christmas this year <br></br>
seeking not the image I have created, <br></br>
but the Christ begotten of the Father, <br></br>
recognizing that the manger of Bethlehem <br></br>
was but the first stop on the journey to the cross.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

  <title>Prayer for Advent 4</title>

 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Dec 20, 2016 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Father of Light,
</p>

 <p>
The creator of the universe <br></br>
came to us as a helpless child, <br></br>
reminding us that there is no <br></br>
reconciliation without risk <br></br>
or love without a chance of loss.
</p>

 <p>
But we sacrificed peace <br></br>
on the altar of security, <br></br>
preferring to remain in darkness <br></br>
than to venture out into the light, <br></br>
desiring our kingdom more than yours.
</p>

 <p>
Give us the courage <br></br>
to drop our guard, <br></br>
and open our lives <br></br>
both to you and <br></br>
to one another.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>Christmas Communion Liturgy</title>

  <summary>Dec 21, 2016 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Christmas Communion Liturgy</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Dec 21, 2016 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Peace be with you,
</p>

 <p>
When a new emperor took the throne in Rome, messengers were sent to the rich and powerful to deliver “glad tidings” of Caesar, who was called “savior and lord” and promised to bring peace to the empire through the power of his vast riches and his mighty armies.
</p>

 <p>
But when the King was born in Bethlehem, messengers from God were sent, not to the rich and powerful, but to those too poor to be noticed by the empire.
</p>

 <p>
And for the first time, they heard glad tidings of good news, that peace would come to the world, not by the power of force, but by the power of love, not through a conquering army, but through the crucified Christ.
</p>

 <p>
The messiah had come, but the city of Bethlehem was unprepared. There was no welcome; there was no room. His birth was largely ignored by the powerful, and noticed only by some shepherds and a few foreigners.
</p>

 <p>
We, like Bethlehem, were also unprepared, but thanks be to God that even in our uncertainty, Christ called to us; even in our hesitation, Christ came to us; even in our sin, Christ died for us.
</p>

 <p>
Christmas reminds us that ready or not, God has come into the world, and we are not alone. By sharing communion together we recognize and remember God’s presence and proclaim the great mystery of the faith: <br></br></p>

 <p>
Christ has died, <br></br>
Christ has risen, <br></br>
and Christ will come again.
</p>

 <p>
We stand before the table, surrounded by God’s people, who will soon partake together — powerful symbols of God’s presence and his grace.
</p>

 <p>
God before you, <br></br>
God around you, <br></br>
God within you.
</p>

 <p>
Come to his table.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Taking of the bread.</i>
</p>

 <p>
Christ’s body was broken not just to make a statement, and not merely for the sake of some cause.
</p>

 <p>
Christ’s body was broken for you, and for me.
</p>

 <p>
Eat, and remember.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Taking of the cup.</i>
</p>

 <p>
Just as his body was broken, his blood was shed, and God died, so that we may live.
</p>

 <p>
Drink, and give thanks.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

Who am I this Christmas Day?
</p>

 <p>
Am I an angel, bringing good news to those who yearn to hear it?
</p>

 <p>
Am I a shepherd, who runs to see what God has done?
</p>

 <p>
Am I a Magi, willing to give any gift to the King?
</p>

 <p>
Am I Joseph, listening to any way that God might speak? <br></br></p>

 <p>
Am I Mary, saying yes when others would jeer?
</p>

 <p>
In the moments of stillness, <br></br>
when all pretensions are dropped, <br></br>
I fear that I may be Herod, <br></br>
safe and comfortable, <br></br>
but afraid of what might change. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Lord, you know my true self, <br></br>
both what I am <br></br>
and what I can be, <br></br>
by your grace. <br></br></p>

  <title>Walls</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Dec 28, 2016 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Walls</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Dec 28, 2016 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
In light of the recent political discussion concerning building walls, here is a devotional that I wrote in 2009 when the church assisted on a Habitat for Humanity project.
</p>

 <p>
I’m usually in favor of building walls, but not when it just becomes another way to burn bridges.
</p>
 <section id="outline-container-orgfeee9d2" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="orgfeee9d2">Prayer</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfeee9d2">
 <p>
Almighty God, 
</p>

 <p>
I give thanks for those who are here today to help build this house, for those who have already worked to bring us to this point, and for those who will be here in the future. May you watch over all that happens here, filling us all with the joy of doing your work.
</p>

 <p>
We pray also that your blessings will fill this house and those who will live here. May the sounds of laughter echo from these walls, and may love fill these rooms.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
</div>
</section> <section id="outline-container-orgd5f18a8" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="orgd5f18a8">Devotional</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd5f18a8">
 <p>
Even though the ones that we see here are far from finished, we should never underestimate the importance of building walls. Nehemiah left the court of the Persian king to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. For the people of Jerusalem, walls represented safety, security, and an opportunity to be the people of God free from oppression by the enemies that surrounded them.
</p>

 <p>
Not all walls are good, though. I’m speaking of the walls that we build that separate communities, that keep us apart, those invisible walls that we erect to protect our own comfort zones. In some ways, these are the walls that we cherish the most, but it is these walls that God wants torn down. As Paul says in 1 Corinthians 1:10, “Now I appeal to you, brothers and sisters,​ by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you be in agreement and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same purpose.”
</p>

 <p>
We come here from different backgrounds, different families, and different churches. This is an opportunity to build some very important walls, but also maybe to tear down a few walls. May what we do here express that great truth of the Gospel expressed in Galatians 3:28, “There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus.”
</p>

 <p>
So go now, building those walls that need to go up, and tearing down those walls that need to come down. 
</p>

 <p>
In the name of Jesus, 
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>Disagreement and Being Wrong</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jan 09, 2017 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Disagreement and Being Wrong</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 09, 2017 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
This internet meme has been making the rounds lately:
</p>

 <div class="org-center">

 <figure id="org1fabbcf"> <img src="../images/posts/20170109-disagreement.jpg" alt="20170109-disagreement.jpg" width="100%"></img></figure></div>

 <p>
The graphic shows two people on opposite ends of an ambiguous figure on the ground. One person points down and says “Six.” The other points down, saying “Nine.” The original caption is “Just because you are right, does not mean I am wrong.” That caption is crossed out, and this rebuttal placed below:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
But one of those people is wrong, someone painted a six or nine, they need to back up ad orient themselves, see if there are any other numbers to alight with. Maybe there’s a driveway of a building to face, or they can ask someone who actually knows.
</p>

 <p>
People having an uninformed opinion about something they don’t understand and proclaiming their opinion as being equally valid as facts is what is ruining the world. No one wants to do any research, they just want to be right.
</p>
</blockquote>


 <p>
There are number of things wrong here. First, the minor and less interesting problems:
</p>

 <ol class="org-ol"> <li>The distinction between opinion and fact — an opinion is just something someone believes. A fact is something that is the case. True opinions express facts; false ones do not. So, an opinion can very well be as “valid” as a fact, if it indeed expresses a fact.</li>
 <li>I do think that people having uninformed (I assume that is what was meant, not “uniformed”) opinions is bad, however, I suspect there are worse problems in the world. Failure to be informed is not evidence that people want to be right, but that they want to win. There’s an important difference.</li>
</ol> <p>
Now for the more interesting issues:
</p>

 <p>
One thing the explanation gets right is that context is important. Context might very well show that one person is in fact wrong, but context could also show that both are right. The explanation assumes that the figure is painted on the floor or ground, but that’s not clear from the cartoon. Another possibility is that the two people are looking at a large sign that was not intentionally placed, but simply laid down. To save money, the sign-maker may have produced 9 different signs for the numerals, intending the same sign to be used for both 6 and 9. So, both are correct. It is both a 6 and 9. The explanation assumes that the person who placed the figure there was trying to communicate something, but that isn’t necessarily the case.
</p>

 <p>
Another possibility, imagine that the two people live directly across the street from each other — one at 6 Elm Street and the other at 9 Elm Street. Not being very bright, they thought it would be cute to paint this large figure on the street between their houses. One points out that it is a 6, the other, a 9. Both walk away happy, and there is no real disagreement.
</p>

 <p>
To the broader point communicated by the original statement:
</p>

 <p>
We’ve all probably had disagreements that seemed irresolvable. Then, after some patient discussion, one person says, “You know, I think we’re really saying the same thing.” We often find that there are many different ways to express the same thought. One way being right does not mean that the others are wrong.
</p>

 <p>
Statements also have meaning relative to a linguistic context. We may assume the other is wrong, but we’ve just misunderstood the context. For example, one person says that it is 25 degrees outside, but another says that it is -4. Can they both be right? Of course, if they are assuming different temperature scales.
</p>

 <p>
So, in cases of disagreement, there are several possibilities:
</p>

 <ol class="org-ol"> <li>The disagreement is merely apparent. The parties believe the same thing, but do not understand each other.</li>
 <li>The disagreement is genuine, and the issue is such that only one party can be correct.</li>
 <li>The disagreement is genuine, but the issue is such that, even though they don’t realize it, both parties can be correct.</li>
</ol> <p>
To know if someone’s being right entails that another person is wrong, I have to know facts about the question, the issue, the linguistic context, etc. That’s often not very difficult, but sometimes it is very hard. It’s important to note that we are always hypothesizing about these things and our assumptions may be wrong. So, in situations of disagreement, maybe we should try to exercise a bit more charity.
</p>

 <p>
In the end, then, it is both one person’s being right and facts about context that determine if the other person must be wrong. So, the original statement stands, one person’s being right is not alone enough to guarantee that another person is wrong. We should certainly seek to be informed, but we should also seek to understand.

</header> <p>
Holy God,
</p>

 <p>
The greatest tragedy <br></br>
is not to hate God, <br></br>
for the one who hates <br></br>
has God ever present <br></br>
before his mind.
</p>

 <p>
It is ambivalence, <br></br>
thoughtless and uncaring, <br></br>
a life that is at once <br></br>
both full and empty, <br></br>
full of trivialities, <br></br>
yet empty of meaning
</p>

 <p>
Heal my lukewarm heart, Lord, <br></br>
and restore me to my first love.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

</header> <blockquote>
 <p>
And perhaps the great day will come when a people, distinguished by wars and victories and by the highest development of a military order and intelligence, and accustomed to make the heaviest sacrifices for these things, will exclaim of its own free will, “We break the sword,” and will smash its entire military establishment down to its lowest foundations. Rendering oneself unarmed when one has been the best-armed, out of a height of feeling—that is the means to real peace, which must always rest on a peace of mind; whereas the so-called armed peace, as it now exists in all countries, is the absence of peace of mind. One trusts neither oneself nor one’s neighbor and, half from hatred, half from fear, does not lay down arms. Rather perish than hate and fear, and twice rather perish than make oneself hated and feared—this must some day become the highest maxim for every single commonwealth, too.

Gracious God,
</p>

 <p>
We live in a time of change, <br></br>
sometimes inspiring and exciting, <br></br>
sometimes distressing and frightening, <br></br>
but always challenging.
</p>

 <p>
Yet even in the midst of upheaval, <br></br>
we can be sure of this:
</p>

 <p>
The Father still loves us, <br></br>
the Son still calls us, <br></br>
The Spirit still leads us, <br></br>
and we must still follow – <br></br></p>

 <p>
Together, <br></br>
one body, <br></br>
one faith.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

We thank God <br></br>

Lord,

If we are to fight, <br></br>

For I believe the crisis in the U.S. church has almost nothing to do with being liberal or conservative; it has everything to do with giving up on the faith and discipline of our Christian baptism and settling for a common, generic U.S. identity that is part patriotism, part consumerism, part violence, and part affluence.

  <title>Usury in Oklahoma</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Mar 14, 2017 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Usury in Oklahoma</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Mar 14, 2017 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Yesterday, the House of Representatives of the State of Oklahoma passed  <a href="http://www.oklegislature.gov/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=Hb1913&Session=1700">HB 1913</a>, a bill giving lenders the ability to charge an Annual Percentage Rate of 205.92% on a $1,500 loan. <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup></p>

 <p>
This bill is inconsistent with historical Christian values and should be opposed by conservatives and progressives alike. The practice of taking interest on loans is expressly forbidden in several passages of Scripture:
</p>

 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>Exodus 22:25-27</li>
 <li>Leviticus 25:35-38</li>
 <li>Deuteronomy 23:19-20; 24:6</li>
 <li>Psalm 15:5</li>
 <li>Ezekiel 18:7-8; 22:12</li>
 <li>Nehemiah 5:6-13 <sup> <a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup></li>
</ul> <p>
Before 1500, every Christian writer who discussed the practice expressly condemned the practice of charging interest. Ambrose called it wicked, and Augustine, in the  <i>Enarration on Psalm 129</i> said that the person who loaned at interest would “…go into the flame.” Like the church fathers, every church council that discussed loaning at interest condemned it. Luther also condemned charging interest, although Calvin did not. Calvin saw interest as a necessity in a fallen world, since the lender is risking non-payment. Interestingly, though, in his  <i>Commentary on the First Twenty Chapters of Ezekiel</i>, he said “It is always wrong to exact usury from a poor man.” For Calvin, it looks like interest can be charged, just not to the poor. One could also appeal to the Founding Fathers. The colonies set an interest cap of 8%. After 1776, most states limited interest at 6%.
</p>

 <p>
Note that the Bible and the Church for the first 1600 years of its existence defined usury simply as charging interest on a loan. We now define it as charging excessive interest, which shows a compromise to the modern world. Regardless, taking a stand against this bill is taking a stand for traditional Christian values; something the right should certainly support.

  <title>Obama&apos;s Economic Record</title>

  <summary>Mar 16, 2017 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Obama’s Economic Record</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Mar 16, 2017 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
In a recent discussion, one participant claimed that the “last eight years of Obamanomics has crippled our struggling state,” which I suspect is supported more by a political narrative than an analysis of the data.
</p>

 <p>
The new administration is at least fortunate that the problems handed to them are not at the same level as those handed to the previous administration. During the Obama administration, economic growth was admittedly slow, but considering that he took office on the precipice of what could have been the second great depression, these national numbers look pretty good:
</p>

 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>Longest streak in US history of private sector job growth, the difference can be noted by comparing 2008 and 2016 numbers:
 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>In November 2008, the economy lost 533,000 jobs.</li>
 <li>In November 2016, the economy gained 178,000 jobs.</li>
</ul></li>
 <li>Unemployment dropped from 10% to 4.6%.</li>
 <li>800 billion dollar decrease in deficit.</li>

To be fair, the economic numbers for the Obama administration are not all rosy, however. A significant worry is the increase in the national debt. Obama’s policies added 983 billion dollars to the national debt. The budget deficits under his administration increased the debt by 6.5 trillion. <sup> <a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup></p>

If the economy of Oklahoma has been crippled, surely the state government, dominated by the right, has played a significant role.

Determining how much of the national debt a president is responsible for is a tricky matter. One could just look at the total increase in the national debt, but that unfairly saddles a president with a debt increase during the first year that results from the previous president’s final-year budget. One could also add up the deficits of the president’s budgets, which is fairer than the first method, but saddles the president with deficit spending that was either out of the president’s  control or not a result of the administration’s policies. The third method, which is the most meaningful but hardest to calculate, is to determine how much the president’s policies contributed to the national debt. 
Kimberly Amadeo provides a clear explanation of these methods, along with the resulting numbers,  <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/national-debt-under-obama-3306293">here</a>.

Holy God,
</p>

 <p>
Examine my thoughts <br></br>
on this Palm Sunday.
</p>

 <p>
Does my Jesus… <br></br></p>

 <p>
Want the very same things I want? <br></br>
Love only the same people I love? <br></br>
Hate all of the same people I hate? <br></br>
Have an agenda that fits too easily into my own agenda? <br></br>
Never say anything that makes me uncomfortable? <br></br></p>

 <p>
If so, then what is the object of my worship? <br></br>
Is it a god of my own creation, <br></br>
or is it the God who created me?
</p>

 <p>
Test my heart, O Lord, <br></br>
and may my innermost desires <br></br>
be made transparent,
</p>

 <p>
Even to myself.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>Thoughts on Maundy Thursday</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Apr 13, 2017 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Thoughts on Maundy Thursday</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Apr 13, 2017 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
This day of the church calendar, Maundy Thursday, gets its name from John 13:34, which, in the Latin Vulgate, begins with “mandatum novum” — a new commandment. After washing the feet of the disciples earlier in chapter 13, Jesus told them,
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
A commandment to love, though, should strike us as odd, because we generally think of love as a feeling or emotion. It makes no sense to command a feeling or emotion, however, for those are not within our immediate control. We can only be commanded to act. So, unless Jesus’ command is simply pointless, love must be a way of acting, or living as Jesus lived; in his words, “For I have set you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you.” (John 13:15)
</p>

 <p>
I have good reason to continue to think of love as just an emotion. By thinking of love as a feeling, I avoid having to keep the commandment to love. So, I have taken something that I simply do not want to do, and turned it into something that is impossible for me to do. As long as I pretend it is impossible, I can deny that there is any obligation to keep the commandment. That way, I can go on loving only those whom I like, and thus continue to rest comfortably in my own self-righteousness.
</p>

 <p>
May God forgive me.
</p>

 <p>
It is a sign <br></br>

what it means <br></br>
for God to die, <br></br>
that we remember <br></br>
this day when <br></br>

 <p>
What our minds cannot comprehend, <br></br>
our words cannot express.

  <title>Thoughts on Trump and the Johnson Amendment</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>May 04, 2017 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Thoughts on Trump and the Johnson Amendment</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">May 04, 2017 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Some thoughts on President Trump’s Executive Order on “Promoting  Free Speech and Religious Liberty” that was recently issued:
</p>

 <p>
First of all, the President’s executive order doesn’t change anything about religious leaders engaging in political action from the pulpit.  This is from section 2, the relevant part of the order:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
The Secretary of the Treasury shall ensure, to the extent permitted by law, that the Department of the Treasury does not take any adverse action against any individual, house of worship, or other religious organization on the basis that such individual or organization speaks or has spoken about moral or political issues from a religious perspective, where speech of similar character has, consistent with law, not ordinarily been treated as participation or intervention in a political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) a candidate for public office by the Department of the Treasury.
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
All it says is that speech that has so far been considered consistent with the law should continue to be considered consistent with the law. Nothing changes, so foes of the Johnson Amendment should be severely disappointed. It is, like much of what seems to be coming from Washington these days, Shakespearean: “full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.”
</p>

 <p>
Given recent discussions, it appears that the current law is severely misunderstood by many. Most political activity by churches is, and has always been, completely legal. Churches and leaders have always been allowed to speak on issues, legislation, and most matters of political concern. What pastors are not allowed to do is to campaign, in their role as pastors, for candidates. That is, they are to refrain from partisan campaigning in exchange for the tax-exempt status of their churches.
</p>

 <p>
Regardless of Johnson’s motivation for desiring this (which, knowing Johnson, was likely not altogether virtuous), it is a good thing. Granting tax-exempt status is subsidizing religious activity – churches, synagogues, and even mosques get services from the city for which they pay nothing, services like police and fire protection. For these free services, only one accommodation is required, that is to refrain from campaigning for candidates. 
</p>

 <p>
The law in no way restricts the free speech rights of anyone. Churches are always welcome to give up their tax-exempt status. Churches should just not expect citizens to pay for their campaigning by means of that tax-exempt status. If the current law is changed, then note that citizens will be subsidizing, through the taxes which pay for police, fire departments, etc., the political campaigns of candidates that they do not support.

It is finals week here at Oklahoma Baptist University. Here is a prayer for students:
</p>

 <p>
Dear students,
</p>

 <p>
May God calm your anxieties, <br></br>
refresh your minds, <br></br>
and honor the faithfulness <br></br>
you have shown this semester.
</p>

 <p>
Remember that God has gifted you <br></br>
more than you can imagine, <br></br>
and you are capable of more <br></br>
than you’ve ever dreamed.
</p>

 <p>
May the great wisdom of the Father, <br></br>
the incomparable love of the Son, <br></br>
and the mighty power of the Spirit <br></br>
be with you all this week.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>Pentecost Prayer</title>

  <summary>Jun 03, 2017 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Pentecost Prayer</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jun 03, 2017 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
A prayer for tomorrow’s sermon at Spring Creek Baptist Church:
</p>

 <p>
God of life,
</p>

 <p>
Sometimes our prayers are as parched as the desert <br></br>
and our hearts as dry as the dunes of sand.
</p>

 <p>
We take offense at things that don’t matter, <br></br>
but ignore the ones that do.
</p>

 <p>
When others are hungry, <br></br>
we are full.
</p>

 <p>
When others are hurting, <br></br>
we are numb.
</p>

 <p>
When others are cold, <br></br>
we rest comfortably <br></br>
beneath warm blankets of apathy.
</p>

 <p>
But even in our self-righteousness, <br></br>
we still feel something, <br></br>
a deep ache of longing, <br></br>
a thirst for something <br></br>
greater than ourselves, <br></br>
a lingering thought <br></br>
that you are still there. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Emmanuel, <br></br>
God with us. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Despite our weakness, <br></br>
you have called us to be your people, <br></br>
ambassadors of your kingdom.
</p>

 <p>
On this Pentecost Sunday,
lead us once more to the well of your grace, <br></br>
bathe us again in the streams of your mercy.
</p>

 <p>
Open the floodgates of your love, <br></br>
and let the rivers flow.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

  <title>Publishing to Jekyll with Editorial on iOS</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jun 21, 2017 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Publishing to Jekyll with Editorial on iOS</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jun 21, 2017 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
As a blog platform, Jekyll has a number of positive features: 
</p>

 <ol class="org-ol"> <li>The speed and security of a static site,</li>
 <li>The convenience and future-proofing of plain text, and most importantly for educators,</li>
 <li>Free hosting on GitHub.</li>
</ol> <p>
For me, the one drawback has been finding a convenient way to post using my iPad. There are a number of good Markdown editors for iOS, so writing posts is very easy, but publishing them can be a challenge.
  <a href="https://appsto.re/us/xONC1.i">Working Copy</a> works well to manage the Git repository, but it doesn’t have the convenience that I wanted, and I really don’t need to store my whole Jekyll repository on the iPad.
 I can post using  <a href="https://appsto.re/us/PTVR2.i">Prompt 2</a> and my 
Linux server on  <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>.  Neither of these are the simple write-and-post workflows that the iPad calls for, though.
</p>

 <p>
Yesterday, I found this  <a href="http://www.editorial-workflows.com/workflow/5838419494174720/XyeFJfsyXwE">workflow</a> by Max Jacobson. The first time it is run, it takes you to GitHub to generate an access token. After giving it the access token, the workflow will generate a file name in the correct format, prepare a commit message, and push the post to GitHub. <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup></p>

 <p>
Now, I’m one step closer to being able to use the iPad as a desktop replacement.

  <title>Making Beautiful Things</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jun 26, 2017 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Making Beautiful Things</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jun 26, 2017 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Yesterday’s worship at  <a href="http://www.northhavenchurch.net">NorthHaven Church</a> was planned and led by Autumn Lockett, Josh Lockett, and Chris Canary. I was particularly struck by the words of one of the songs: “You make beautiful things out of the dust… You make beautiful things out of us.”
</p>

 <p>
Those words were exemplified later when the members of the congregation gathered to each put fingerprint leaves on Josh Lockett’s sketch of a tree, fingerprints from the young and the old, from those who have been in the community for years, and from those who have been there for only months. Each contributed to the beauty of the painting, just as each has contributed to the beauty that is the NorthHaven community, diverse individuals connected by branches of relationship to a common trunk that is NorthHaven Church. When I widen my perspective, though, I see that what looks like a trunk is just another branch — one that is connected to other branches through Jesus Christ, and together we form the tree that is the Church, holy and catholic.
</p>

 <p>
May God continue to make beautiful things out of all of us.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

  <title>Moving to Hugo</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jul 02, 2017 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Moving to Hugo</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jul 02, 2017 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
It’s been longer than usual since I made a redesign of the web site.  <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> had been serving my purposes well, but I managed to concoct two excuses for changing. I’ve been slightly uncomfortable with handling the various dependencies with respect to other Ruby gems. Unsurprisingly, as the site got bigger and bigger, the time that Jekyll took to build the site has gotten longer and longer. The real reason for the redesign, though, is that I just like the chance to learn and work with something new.
</p>

 <p>
I thought about  <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com">Pelican</a>, which is similar to Jekyll, but written in Python. I’m more comfortable hacking around in Python than I am in Ruby, but that was the only advantage I could see with Pelican.  <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> has been getting a lot of press lately, and everyone remarked about it’s apparently amazing build speed. It also installs as a single binary, so there is no need to manage dependencies.
</p>

 <p>
Building the Hugo site was relatively simple, and anyone with some experience with any static site generator should have no problem. Hugo has a  <a href="https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_import_jekyll/">command</a> to import a Jekyll blog, which worked very well. I had to clean up some meta-data, but after a bit of search and replace magic with regular expressions on the post directory, everything worked. <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup></p>

 <p>
I thought about designing my own theme, but quickly discovered that it would take more time than I need to be spending now, so found this excellent academic oriented theme by  <a href="https://georgecushen.com">George Cushen</a>, cleverly called “ <a href="https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic">Academic</a>.” 
</p>

 <p>
The Internet chatter was correct — the site builds very quickly. <sup> <a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> I saw soon face, though, with the one disadvantage of Hugo compared to Jekyll, at least for me. As a professor at a small liberal arts college with a primary revenue stream of tuition, I prefer to use free services when possible. Github hosting was ideal. Since a large portion was powered by Jekyll, I could just push the source to Github. Github would build and serve the site automatically. It met two important criteria, simple and free. I was especially happy with that after discovering how to easily  <a href="2017-06-21-jekyll-ios-workflow.html">post from iOS</a>.
</p>

 <p>
Now, I had to build the Hugo site, then push the source to one repository and the HTML to another. It wasn’t difficult, but it didn’t have the single-step ease that I wanted. I stumbled on  <a href="https://forestry.io">Forestry</a>, which is a CMS for Jekyll and Hugo sites. It works amazingly well, and could be a great tool for people who want the benefits of static sites but don’t want to mess with the command line. It can be configured to build and push to the deployment repository when a change is made to the source repository.  For me at least, it didn’t work well  <b>in conjunction</b> with the command line, though. When it rebuilt the site, it changed a number of source files, and I would forget to pull those changes before working on something. I was soon tired of cleaning up merge conflicts. 
</p>

 <p>
Many people use either  <a href="https://www.travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a> or  <a href="http://www.wercker.com">Wercker</a> for deploying static sites. Both are tools for building and deploying software, but will also build and deploy static sites. Unfortunately, I just couldn’t manage to make either one work. Finally, I stumbled on  <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a>. Netlify is a bit different from the others in that it builds and hosts, and, for the service that I need, all for free. It was easy to configure, the build worked perfectly, and I just had to point the domain to Netlify instead of Github. I write using Emacs or Editorial, push the post to Github, Netlify detects the change, then builds and serves the site. For anyone who is interested, the source code for the site is on  <a href="https://github.com/rlridenour/blog">Github</a>.

There was a bit more to it. Finding what to search for and replace was a bit of a hassle. The Hugo build-error messages weren’t particularly helpful. I debugged by moving the files out of the post directory, then replacing some until I could find a file that failed to build. Then, it was easy to see what part of the meta-data was causing the problem, and fix it with a global search and replace. If the site is fairly large, it’s easily worth it to learn a bit about regular expressions and invest some time in becoming comfortable with a good text editor that can do a multi-file search and replace.

God of Love,
</p>

 <p>
When I see a stranger, <br></br>
do you see a beloved child?
</p>

 <p>
When I see an enemy, <br></br>
do you see a friend?
</p>

 <p>
May I see what is, <br></br>
and not what I fear might be.
</p>

 <p>
Even more, <br></br>
may I see what could be, <br></br>
if I were to give even a fraction <br></br>
of the grace that I have received.

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Sep 04, 2017 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
God of Hope,
</p>

 <p>
I claim to be person of faith, <br></br>
yet live as a person of fear.
</p>

 <p>
I build walls, <br></br>
because I fear the stranger;
</p>

 <p>
Hold on to the present, <br></br>
because I fear the future.
</p>

 <p>
And make my own plans, <br></br>
because I do not trust yours.
</p>

 <p>
What a fool to think <br></br>
that what I do out of fear <br></br>
could ever be better than <br></br>
what you do out of love.
</p>

 <p>
Thanks be to God, <br></br>
there is no wall that cannot be torn down, <br></br>
no stranger that cannot be a friend, <br></br>
and no future that cannot be redeemed.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Sep 24, 2017 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
One of last week’s lectionary texts was Romans 14:1-12.
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
Why do you pass judgment on your brother or sister? Or you, why do you despise your brother or sister? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God. (Rom. 14:10, NRSV)
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
God of Grace,
</p>

 <p>
In belittling others, <br></br>
I am made small.
</p>

 <p>
By doubting their faith, <br></br>
I cheapen my own.
</p>

 <p>
In my haste to judge, <br></br>
I am the one condemned.
</p>

 <p>
The day will come, <br></br>
when my time on earth <br></br>
is finally weighed.
</p>

 <p>
If I am found wanting, <br></br>
let it be for my <br></br>
failure to judge, <br></br>
and not for my <br></br>
failure to love.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

Holy God,
</p>

 <p>
Thank you <br></br>
for the one <br></br>
who offends me, <br></br>
for in offense <br></br>
my heart is laid bare <br></br>
and my idols are revealed.
</p>

 <p>
My anger declares <br></br>
the object of my worship.
</p>

 <p>
Is it myself, <br></br>
the empire, <br></br>
or you?
</p>

 <p>
Lord, have mercy.
</p>

  <title>The Burden of Freedom</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">The Burden of Freedom</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Oct 12, 2017 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Hearing the sermon on Sunday, then reading Abraham Joshua Heschel on Monday and Flannery O’Connor on Tuesday – they all seemed to be speaking the same thing to me. This week’s prayer:
</p>

 <p>
Lord,
</p>

 <p>
I feel the weight of my choices, <br></br>
bearing down upon my conscience, <br></br>
each one a testimony to the truth <br></br>
that those who do evil <br></br>
have their greatest allies <br></br>
in those who do nothing.
</p>

 <p>
The burden of freedom is this, <br></br>
though only some are guilty, <br></br>
we are all surely responsible.
</p>

 <p>
We ask not that this burden <br></br>
be taken from us, but instead, <br></br>
that we bear it with more <br></br>
than the empty thoughts and prayers <br></br>
of those who just pass by, <br></br>
but with the grace and love <br></br>
of the Samaritan <br></br>
that leads to action.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

  <title>When the Idols are Destroyed</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">When the Idols are Destroyed</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Oct 24, 2017 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Holy God,
</p>

 <p>
We come to you bearing many things.  
Some are burdens, but others are idols:
</p>

 <p>
The idol of superiority,
</p>

 <p>
The idol of certainty,
</p>

 <p>
The idol of believing that   
we are the gatekeepers to your kingdom,
</p>

 <p>
The idol of making the gospel   
an object of mere belief,  
and not a way of life.
</p>

 <p>
But when the burdens are lifted,  
and the idols are destroyed,  
What remains is truly precious:
</p>

 <p>
Women and men in community,  
Gifted people of all ages  
working together so that  
your kingdom may come,  
and your will be done  
even here, even now.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Nov 19, 2017 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
God of compassion,
</p>

 <p>
There are times when it <br></br>
seems impossible to give thanks, <br></br>
for the loss is too recent <br></br>
and the pain is too great.
</p>

 <p>
But in this, we have hope, <br></br>
That even in the darkest valley, <br></br>
we are not alone, for you are there
</p>

 <p>
And our hope is not in vain, <br></br>
for we see your presence in <br></br>
the church, the body of Christ, <br></br>
which walks beside us.
</p>

 <p>
Give us the grace and love <br></br>
to maintain this community, <br></br>
so that our hope may be proclaimed, <br></br>
again, and again, and again, <br></br>
until that day when Christ himself <br></br>
will wipe every tear from every eye.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

 <p>
Peace is not merely the absence of war; it is also the overcoming of injustice and oppression. In positive terms, it is life that is blessed, affirmed, loved and successful–life as shalom. Anyone who wants to serve peace must serve life. He must therefore resist war, because this is the deadliest form of discord. But this resistance against war is only one part of a much wider devotion to life. The service of peace is the whole task of life.

  <title>No Democrat Voted for What?</title>

</header> <p>
I just saw an internet meme that said, “Not a single Democrat voted to lower your taxes — let that sink in for a moment.”
</p>

 <p>
I guess that’s another way of pointing out that not a single Democrat voted to raise the federal deficit by 1.4 trillion dollars in ten years.

  <title>Ordination Prayer</title>

  <summary>Dec 09, 2017 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Ordination Prayer</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Dec 09, 2017 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
 <i>This is a prayer for an ordination service at NorthHaven Church on December 9, 2017</i>
</p>

 <p>
God of grace and hope,
</p>

 <p>
We confess that, sometimes, <br></br>
we are like Israel in Egypt, <br></br>
overwhelmed by life and <br></br>
tempted to believe that <br></br>
you have abandoned your people.
</p>

 <p>
In this, though, we have hope, <br></br>
though Israel had forgotten you, <br></br>
you did not abandon her. <br></br>
Instead, you called Moses <br></br>
to be her minister.
</p>

 <p>
And so, from the desert <br></br>
of our dry and parched lives, <br></br>
you continue to call — <br></br>
not from a burning bush, <br></br>
but from within, <br></br>
from a heart aflame <br></br>
with passion for <br></br>
the kingdom of God <br></br>
and for your people.
</p>

 <p>
Today, we give thanks for Kim, <br></br>
a minister with such a heart, <br></br>
who, like Moses, <br></br>
has answered your call.
</p>

 <p>
Grant her the vision <br></br>
to see things as they are, <br></br>
and the spiritual imagination <br></br>
to recognize what they could be.
</p>

 <p>
May her laughter be joyful; <br></br>
her anger, righteous; <br></br>
her compassion, gentle; <br></br>
her witness, bold; <br></br>
and her love, deep.
</p>

 <p>
Fill her with the <br></br>
power of the Almighty, <br></br>
who took what was <br></br>
formless and void <br></br>
and created the universe, <br></br>
then declared it good.
</p>

 <p>
May her ministry <br></br>
be the means by which <br></br>
you continue to take <br></br>
what is broken and empty, <br></br>
and create that which is <br></br>
new, beautiful and good.
</p>

 <p>
In the name of the Father <br></br>
who gives us our mission, <br></br>
and of the Son, <br></br>
whose obedience is our model, <br></br>
and of the Spirit, <br></br>
who gives us strength <br></br>
for our task.
</p>

 <p>
Three persons, <br></br>
one God, <br></br>
forever and ever.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>Prayer for the Fourth Sunday of Advent</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Dec 24, 2017 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Prayer for the Fourth Sunday of Advent</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Dec 24, 2017 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
A prayer for Mitch Randall’s last Sunday as pastor of NorthHaven Church, before he takes his new position as executive director of the Baptist Center for Ethics.
</p>

 <p>
God of peace and joy,
</p>

 <p>
For centuries, <br></br>
Israel anticipated <br></br>
the coming of the Messiah; <br></br>
and as one expectation <br></br>
was fulfilled, <br></br>
another was born, <br></br>
for we still long <br></br>
for the day when <br></br>
that same Messiah <br></br>
will come again.
</p>

 <p>
Christmas is still a day <br></br>
when old dreams are fulfilled, <br></br>
and new dreams are born.
</p>

 <p>
We give thanks for what <br></br>
this church has become <br></br>
in the years that Mitch <br></br>
has been with us:
</p>

 <p>
For those who have <br></br>
been rejected, <br></br>
it is a place to feel welcome.
</p>

 <p>
For those who have <br></br>
felt constrained, <br></br>
a place to be free.
</p>

 <p>
For those whose gifts <br></br>
have been denied, <br></br>
a place to serve.
</p>

 <p>
And so it is fitting <br></br>
that at Christmas <br></br>
We share with the world. <br></br>
this gift that we have received,
</p>

 <p>
And may we, through our <br></br>
words, actions, and gifts, <br></br>
declare to the world <br></br>
that there is still <br></br>
good news of glad tidings, <br></br>
for all people, everywhere.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

  <title>Move to WordPress</title>

I’m trying to use the iPad for more things now. I liked using both Jekyll and Hugo for static sites, but WordPress is much easier to use on iOS. Years ago, I had a blog on  <a href="https://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a> that was still online, so I moved all of my posts there. Importing was a little tricky – I had to install a local copy of Wordpress, and import everything from my RSS feed. I then exported to a WordPress backup file, cleaned that up with Emacs, then re-imported to the local copy of WordPress. Once everything looked reasonably good, I imported it into WordPress.com. There are probably still some posts with formatting problems. I’ll clean those up as I notice them.

  <title>Truth Tables in LaTeX</title>

Typesetting truth tables has never been easy. LaTeX is the gold standard for displaying logic and mathematics, but tables are awkward to edit at best. Tables are much simpler in Microsoft Word, but displaying formulas is a horrible experience. <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>
Here is my current workflow.
</p>

 <p>
The text that I’m using this semester is  <a href="https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/introduction-to-formal-logic-with-philosophical-applications-9780199386482?cc=us&lang=en&">Introduction to Formal Logic with Philosophical Applications</a> by Russell Marcus. Instead of arrows and the ampersand, it uses the horseshoe, triple bar, and dot. So, I add the following lines to my LaTeX preamble to simplify entering the symbols. <sup> <a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup></p>


 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-latex"> <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\newcommand</span></span>{ <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-function-name">\lneg</span></span>}{ <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-function-name">\mathord</span></span> <span class="org-function-name">{</span> <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-function-name">\sim</span></span> <span class="org-function-name">}</span>}
 <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\renewcommand</span></span>{ <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-function-name">\land</span></span>}{ <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-function-name">\bullet</span></span>}
 <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\newcommand</span></span>{ <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-function-name">\lif</span></span>}{ <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-function-name">\supset</span></span>}
 <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\newcommand</span></span>{ <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-function-name">\liff</span></span>}{ <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-function-name">\equiv</span></span>}
</pre>
</div>


 <p>
Then, I enter the truth table in either Excel or Numbers. For example, this would be a simple one line table determining the truth value of a formula for a given valuation:
</p>

 <div class="org-center">

 <figure id="org7ee0368"> <img src="../images/posts/20180210-numbers-truth-table1.png" alt="20180210-numbers-truth-table1.png" width="100%"></img></figure></div>

 <p>
Copy the cells that you want included in the truth table. Go to  <a href="http://www.tablesgenerator.com">Tables Generator</a> and select “LaTeX Tables” from the top menu bar. Below the top menu bar is a drop-down menu bar. Click on “File” then “Paste table data…” and paste the table data. Table Generator will generate a nicely formatted LaTeX table; be sure to uncheck “Escape special TeX symbols” and select the option to remove all borders.
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-latex"> <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\begin</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">table</span>}[]

 <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\end</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">table</span>}
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
I delete the first and last line, leaving just the table data and the lines declaring the tabular environment: 
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-latex"> <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\begin</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">tabular</span>}{cccccccc}
 <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\hline</span></span>

1  <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span> 1  <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span> 1  <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span> 1  <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span> 0     <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span> 0         <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span> 0      <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span> 1   <span class="org-font-latex-warning">\\</span>
 <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\end</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">tabular</span>}
</pre>
</div>


 <p>
At this point, typesetting will fail because the symbols need to be in math mode. So, I’ve found two options. The first is to put all the commands for the symbols in math mode: 
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-latex"> <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\begin</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">tabular</span>}{cccccccc}
 <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\hline</span></span>
P  <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span> Q  <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span> R  <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span> P  <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span>  <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-font-latex-math">\(\lif\)</span></span>  <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span> ( <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-font-latex-math">\(\lneg\)</span></span> Q  <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span>  <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-font-latex-math">\(\land\)</span></span>  <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span> R)  <span class="org-font-latex-warning">\\</span>
1  <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span> 1  <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span> 1  <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span> 1  <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span> 0     <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span> 0         <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span> 0      <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span> 1   <span class="org-font-latex-warning">\\</span>
 <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\end</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">tabular</span>}
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
The second option is to change “tabular” to “array” and put the entire table into math mode:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-latex"> <span class="org-font-latex-math">\[</span>
 <span class="org-font-latex-math">  </span> <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> <span class="org-keyword">\begin</span></span></span> <span class="org-font-latex-math">{</span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> <span class="org-function-name">array</span></span> <span class="org-font-latex-math">}{cccccccc}</span>
 <span class="org-font-latex-math">    </span> <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> <span class="org-keyword">\hline</span></span></span>
 <span class="org-font-latex-math">    P </span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span></span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> Q </span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span></span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> R </span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span></span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> P </span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span></span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> </span> <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-font-latex-math">\lif</span></span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> </span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span></span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> (</span> <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-font-latex-math">\lneg</span></span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> Q </span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span></span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> </span> <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-font-latex-math">\land</span></span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> </span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span></span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> R) </span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> <span class="org-font-latex-warning">\\</span></span>
 <span class="org-font-latex-math">    1 </span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span></span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> 1 </span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span></span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> 1 </span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span></span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> 1 </span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span></span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> 0    </span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span></span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> 0        </span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span></span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> 0     </span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> <span class="org-font-latex-warning">&</span></span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> 1  </span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> <span class="org-font-latex-warning">\\</span></span>
 <span class="org-font-latex-math">    </span> <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> <span class="org-keyword">\end</span></span></span> <span class="org-font-latex-math">{</span> <span class="org-font-latex-math"> <span class="org-function-name">array</span></span> <span class="org-font-latex-math">}</span>
 <span class="org-font-latex-math">  \]</span>
</pre>
</div>



 <p>
Arrays are centered on the page. If you would prefer them printed at the left margin, add “fleqn” to the document class options:  <code>\documentclass[fleqn]{article}</code>. Since the array is in math mode, the letters will be italicized. I use the newtxmath font package, and it has a “frenchmath” option that sets the math font to non-italic. Other math fonts may have a similar option. Finally, whichever option is used, we need to add two lines. Adding a vertical line character to the table or array formatting options will place a vertical line between the valuation section and the rest of the truth table. Adding the booktabs package to the preamble will allow us to separate the sentence letters from the rest of the truth table with a “|” and, if desired, add a border line under the first row of the table.. This gives us the final version,

  <title>Homily for Ash Wednesday</title>

</header> <p>
 <i>Delivered on February 14, 2018 at NorthHaven Church, Norman, Oklahoma.</i> 
</p>

 <p>
Like most people, I have a somewhat love-hate relationship with myself, which means that I also have a love-hate relationship with mirrors. When I pass by a mirror, I can never resist the urge to look, but I’m never completely satisfied with what I see. I look into some mirrors, and I’m confronted with the cold, harsh reality — the ugly truth, as it were. I look into other mirrors, like those found at the carnival, and I like what I see; I’m a bit taller, and a bit thinner. Neither mirror can give me what I need. The first mirror shows me the truth, but only as it is now, whether I want to see it or not. The second mirror shows me what I want to see, even if it could never be possible. What I need is a mirror that shows me what I truly am, but also gives me a glimpse of what I truly could be. That’s the mirror I need, even if it may not be the mirror I want. We have such a mirror in Scripture. In fairness, we must confess that we can bend and distort Scripture so much that it functions exactly like those carnival mirrors, showing exactly what we want to see, confirming our desires and reinforcing our biases. There are times, though, when I come to the text openly and honestly, and it shows me who I am, as I cry with David in Psalm 51:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me. Against you, you alone, have I sinned, and done what is evil in your sight, so that you are justified in your sentence and blameless when you pass judgment. Indeed, I was born guilty, a sinner when my mother conceived me.
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
But Scripture can also show me what is genuinely possible — the beauty of a life lived fully in the Kingdom of God; more than just a glimpse of who I am, but a vision of who God wants me to be. The book of Isaiah was written when the people of Judah desperately needed both of these mirrors. The small nation of Judah, what was left of the once mighty nation of Israel, had not only been defeated by Babylon, but had been taken away in captivity. The people of God were apparently forsaken by their God — prompting the psalmist to lament, “By the rivers of Babylon—there we sat down and there we wept when we remembered Zion.” Even in the midst of that despair, however, there is a voice of hope. We hear it in what are called the “servant songs” of Isaiah, found sprinkled in the text, from chapter 42 through chapter 53. In these passages, God speaks of his promised servant, who will establish justice in chapter 42, be the light to the nations in chapter 49, be vindicated in the face of humiliation in chapter 50, and exalted and lifted up in chapter 52. And so, we sit back and wait for the promised servant, the one who will finally do the will of God. Who is this servant? It is difficult to read chapter 53 and not see Jesus there in the text:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
But he was wounded for our transgressions, <br></br>
crushed for our iniquities; <br></br>
upon him was the punishment that made us whole, <br></br>
and by his bruises we are healed.
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
I do believe that this text speaks prophetically of the Crucified Christ, but that doesn’t mean that the servant songs are simply about Jesus, a point that is made clearly in Isaiah 41:8,
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
But you, Israel, my servant, <br></br>
Jacob, whom I have chosen, <br></br>
the offspring of Abraham, my friend; <br></br>
you whom I took from the ends of the earth, <br></br>
and called from its farthest corners, <br></br>
saying to you, ’You are my servant, ….’
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
A message that is repeated in chapters 44, 45, and 49:  <i>We will see the servant, if we will but look in the mirror</i>. The reflection that we see, however, is harsh and unyielding. It is a clear picture of what God wants us to be: people who seek justice, something that is mentioned three times in the first four verses, yet seek it in a way that is not self-serving. It is a kind of justice that does no harm to the weakest in society — we are to be the light to the nations, helping the blind to see, and freeing those who are in darkness and imprisoned, in a way that does not call attention to ourselves. It is, at the same time, a beautiful image of what can be, and a devastating contrast to what now is, one that forces me to ask, what is it that I really seek? 
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Is it justice, or merely my own advantage?</i> 
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Is it righteousness, or merely my own rights?</i> 
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Is it to serve, or to be the one who is served?</i> 
</p>

 <p>
This day, Ash Wednesday, is the day on which the church is faced with the truth. The ashes are remnants of the palms that we waved on Palm Sunday, a vivid reminder of how quickly our vows of dedication to God become cries of denial and betrayal. We come before the altar of God to hear the humbling words, “Remember, you are but dust, and to dust you shall return.” We come, bringing our pride, our pretension, our vanity, and our feelings of superiority to be cleansed in God’s holy fire. Out of the ashes that are left, God has chosen to raise up his servant. Thanks be to God, for his mercy and grace. 
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

God of compassion, In this week of violence and tragedy, <br></br>
we mourn with those who grieve, <br></br>
cry with those who weep, <br></br>
and sit in silence with those in pain. 
</p>

 <p>
But what should never happen even once <br></br>
seems to happen over and over again, <br></br>
until we are left with nothing <br></br>
but bloodshot eyes and numb hearts. 
</p>

 <p>
Even so, Lord, this is our witness: 
</p>

 <p>
You are with us, <br></br>
and in your presence, <br></br>
We will not be afraid. 
</p>

 <p>
We will not fear the world, <br></br>
for it is your creation. 
</p>

 <p>
We will not fear the future, <br></br>
for you have already redeemed it. 
</p>

 <p>
We will not fear the unknown, <br></br>
for surely you have seen it. 
</p>

 <p>
We will not fear the stranger, <br></br>
for that person was made in your image, <br></br>
even as we are made. 
</p>

 <p>
We will not fear our weakness, <br></br>
for you will give us strength. 
</p>

 <p>
We will not fear the darkness, <br></br>
For we carry the light with us. 
</p>

 <p>
You are there, <br></br>
and we are not alone. 
</p>

 <p>
We will not be afraid. 
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>Homily for Maundy Thursday</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Mar 30, 2018 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Homily for Maundy Thursday</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Mar 30, 2018 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
With the end of every semester comes the last day of class. It’s the perfect opportunity to sum up everything that is important about the subject, and leave students with a final word, something so profound that they will remember it the rest of their lives. In over 20 years of teaching philosophy at the university level, I’ve never been able to do it. One of two things tend to happen. Generally, I’m so far behind that I spend the last class period cramming material in that they need to know for the final exam. At the end of an hour, which I spent talking as fast as I could, and they spent writing as fast as they could, I say something like, “We’re out of time. Good luck on the final, and may God have mercy on your souls.” At other times, I’m just worn out at the end of the semester, and halfway through the last class, just say, “I guess that’s enough.” To borrow a phrase from T.S. Elliot, this is way the class ends, not with a profundity, but with a whimper. Over the past few days, I’ve had the opportunity to think about the context of John chapter 13. My father will be admitted to hospice care tomorrow. He is expected to live for, at most, another week. He is now non-responsive — he cannot speak, and we do not know if he can understand anything we say. So, I am confronted with the realization that, for all I know, my dad and I have already had our last conversation. There is always one chance that is the last chance, but we hardly ever know that it was indeed the last chance. We want our final words to be meaningful, but, because of the ignorance of our human condition, they rarely are. Fortunately, Jesus had an insight that I lacked. Chapters 13 through 17 of the Gospel of John are called the “Farewell Discourse,” and record his final words to his disciples before the events of Good Friday. John tells us that Jesus got up from the table, took off his robe, and tied a towel around himself. He poured water into a washbasin, then knelt and began to wash the feet of his disciples. When he had finished, he said this to them, “Do you know what I have done to you? You call me Teacher and Lord — and you are right, for that is what I am. So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. For I have set you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you.” Then, after he foretold his upcoming betrayal, he got to the heart of the matter. John 13:33–35 records what I believe to be some of the most important words in the Bible:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
Little children, I am with you only a little longer. You will look for me; and as I said to the Jews so now I say to you, “Where I am going, you cannot come.” I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
From this phrase, ’A new commandment,’ or in Latin,  <i>mandatum novum</i>, we get the name for this day in the church calendar, Maundy Thursday. I can picture the disciples nodding their heads in assent as Jesus said these words, for a commandment to love was nothing new. It was already something that every Jew meditated on, and knew by heart: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind” and “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.” Jesus though, did not command his disciples to love their neighbors as themselves; instead, he commanded them to love each other as  <i>he</i> loves them. This might have looked easy on Thursday, but it became practically impossible once the events of Friday unfolded. If we are so commanded, it must be possible to fulfill that command. How, though, can we ever hope to love like Jesus? If we only open our eyes to see, Jesus himself shows us what must be done. When a Jew dies, a small group of people who are known as  <i>chevra kadisha</i> prepare the body for the upcoming burial. The body is first, very reverently undressed, and any wounds on the body are carefull cleansed. Any rings, bracelets, and jewelry are removed. The body is then bathed and purified with water, then wrapped in a white sheet and maybe a prayer cloth. The sheet is tied with a sash that is fastened with a sacred symbol. Only then, is this body ready to meet the living God. When I think of this ritual, I think of Jesus who laid aside his robe and tied a towel around his waist. Today, he is stripped to serve, but tomorrow, he will be stripped to die. Dietrich Bonhoeffer, facing his own impending death, wrote this in his letters from prison: “I think that even in this place we ought to live as if we had no wishes and no future, and just be our true selves.” That is the key, we must strip away all of our pretensions and our pride. We must even, for a moment, forget that there will be a future, and be only who we truly are at this single moment in our lives, with all of our failures, pain, and loss. It is then, and only then, that we can truly love and be truly loved. If we were to live like this, we would find that we never miss a chance for those final words, for we will have been saying them our entire lives. 
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>Family Separation at the Borders</title>

I tend to find most political issues to be difficult and intricate, requiring complex and nuanced responses. So, I believe that there is generally room for rational disagreement when evaluating particular policy decisions. This, however, is not the case with the current administration’s family separation policy — it is simply heinous, cruel, inhumane, and contrary to the teachings of Jesus. We should not return to the Obama administration’s lesser evil of locking up children with their mothers. It is past time for Congress to undertake the difficult task of immigration reform. If God is both just and good, then justice and goodness are not incompatible. We could develop an immigration policy that is both just and good, if we were but willing to do the work. I expressed this today to the offices of my congressional representatives.

On the birthday of Blaise Pascal, consider this wisdom from  <i>The Pensees</i>:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
Right is open to dispute, might is easily recognized and beyond dispute. Therefore right could not be made mighty because might challenged right, calling it unjust and itself claiming to be just. Being thus unable to make right into might, we have made might into right. (L 103)

In  <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>, Dostoevsky uses the slanting rays of the sun to represent the love of God that can flow through each of us, transforming lives as we interact with each other with genuine love.
</p>

 <p>
Now, may the slanting rays of the sun light the path before us, as the love of God surrounds us, to guide us on our journey. May God guard our hearts from anything that might separate us, and shelter us all in his love, forever.

Too often the price exacted by society for security and respectability is that the Christian movement in its formal expression must be on the side of the strong against the weak. This is a matter of tremendous significance, for it reveals to what extent a religion that was born of a people acquainted with persecution and suffering has become the cornerstone of a civilization and of nations whose very position in modern life has too often been secured by a ruthless use of power applied to weak and defenseless peoples.

  <title>My Oklahoma Home</title>

  <summary>Oct 06, 2018 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">My Oklahoma Home</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Oct 06, 2018 00:00</p>

My latest song: <br></br></p>

 <p>
VERSE 1: I-40 East, on a cloudy day, Memphis up ahead, had to get away; Had nothing in mind Just looking for a place to roam. Thought I could see, but I was dumb and blind; Gave no thought to what I left behind, The people that I love, and my Oklahoma home. <br></br></p>

 <p>
CHORUS: They say that heaven’s paved With streets of gold, There’s no more tears Or so I’ve been told No more pain, And no one feels alone. But by those streets Where the children play, I hope to find just a little red clay To remind me Of my Oklahoma home. <br></br></p>

 <p>
VERSE 2: Mind starts to wander when you drive for miles, You think about faces, remember the smiles, And you realize you’re old, But you’ve never ever really grown. So you turn the car into the setting sun, The journey goes on, but the running is done. God help me back To my Oklahoma home. <br></br></p>

 <p>
VERSE 3: You can’t leave, even if you tried, When you’ve got red dirt deep down inside, No matter how much you wanted To leave it alone. When you’re running away to another town, No road is straight, they all circle around, Bringing you back To your Oklahoma home. <br></br></p>

 <p>
BRIDGE: Okemah up ahead, the tears are making me blind, And I hear the voice of Woody deep inside my mind, And It’s taken thirty years, but now I understand, That these are my people, and this is my land, And these Oklahoma hills will always be home.

God of Grace, God of Mercy, We pray today for the people <br></br>
of the Tree of Life congregation <br></br>
in Pittsburgh. We pray for all those <br></br>
who suffer from violence, <br></br>
for those who grieve, <br></br>
and for those who have died <br></br>
because of a hatred that <br></br>
has no point, <br></br>
and makes no sense. May they find comfort in <br></br>
the knowledge of your love, <br></br>
and healing in the support <br></br>
of the community. We ask forgiveness <br></br>
for the ways in which <br></br>
your word has been twisted <br></br>
to support acts of evil. Give us the courage <br></br>
to challenge the evil rhetoric <br></br>
that supports hatred and violence, <br></br>
and to speak the truth boldly, <br></br>
that your love, grace, and mercy <br></br>
extend to all without limit. May the love of your people do the same.

Somewhere in the semester I realized that everything we have gone over in class isn’t just bologna but is actually pretty applicable to life and how I can approach it.

 <p>
That’s definitely a victory in freshman philosophy.

  <title>A Gift for Us</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">A Gift for Us</h1>

This is a Christmas communion hymn, titled “A Gift for Us.” I wrote the lyrics last year, and Cheryl Tarter has written some wonderful music for it. It debuts at tonight’s candlelight service at NorthHaven Church. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Into our darkness, there came a light, <br></br>
As a babe was born on that holy night; <br></br>
The angels sang and the shepherds prayed <br></br>
When the Son of God in a manger lay. <br></br></p>

 <p>
As we eat this bread and drink this cup, <br></br>
We remember that child, a gift for us. <br></br>
As we eat this bread and drink this cup, <br></br>
We remember that child, a gift for us. <br></br></p>

 <p>
The fullness of God in human form, <br></br>
Was that night, in Bethlehem born; <br></br>
Giving up his throne in heaven above, <br></br>
To teach us to serve, to give, and to love. <br></br></p>

 <p>
As we eat this bread and drink this cup, <br></br>
We remember Jesus, a gift for us. <br></br>
As we eat this bread and drink this cup, <br></br>
We remember Jesus, a gift for us. <br></br></p>

 <p>
He came to this world, in all its strife, <br></br>
For our sins, to give his life; <br></br>
Lifted up, with his arms held wide, <br></br>
The Son of God was crucified. <br></br></p>

 <p>
As we eat this bread and drink this cup, <br></br>
We remember our Lord, a gift for us. <br></br>
As we eat this bread and drink this cup, <br></br>
We remember our Lord, a gift for us.

  <title>Arguments in HTML</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jan 08, 2021 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <h1 class="title">Arguments in HTML
 <br></br> <span class="subtitle">Jan 08, 2021 00:00</span>
</h1>
 <p>
This post is not about arguments that occur on the internet, but about how to display philosophical/logical arguments in standard form on the internet. To put an argument in standard form:
</p>

 <ol class="org-ol"> <li>Write each premise on a separate, numbered line,</li>
 <li>Draw a line underneath the last premise, and</li>
 <li>Write the conclusion underneath the line.</li>
</ol> <p>
I’ll first show how to format an argument in HTML, then show an easier way in Markdown with Hugo.
</p>
 <section id="outline-container-html" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="html">HTML</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-html">
 <p>
It’s easy enough to produce an ordered list in HTML, but then the conclusion is numbered, which makes it look like another premise. This can be fixed with a trick in CSS, just add something like this to your stylesheet:
</p>

 <p>
 <code>.list-arg li:last-child { list-style: none }</code>
</p>

 <p>
If one doesn’t need to post very many arguments in standard form, then it might not be worth it to clutter up the main stylesheet with another class. It’s just as easy to add the style specification to each argument, like this:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-html">< <span class="org-function-name">ol</span>>
  < <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
    First Premise
  </ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
  < <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
    < <span class="org-function-name">u</span>> <span class="org-underline">Last Premise</span></ <span class="org-function-name">u</span>>
  </ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
  < <span class="org-function-name">li</span>  <span class="org-variable-name">style</span>= <span class="org-string">"list-style:none;"</span>>
    Conclusion
  </ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
</ <span class="org-function-name">ol</span>>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Both methods produce something that looks like this:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-html">< <span class="org-function-name">ol</span>>
  < <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
    First Premise
  </ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
  < <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
    Last Premise
  </ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
  < <span class="org-function-name">li</span>  <span class="org-variable-name">style</span>= <span class="org-string">"list-style:none;"</span>>
    Conclusion
</ <span class="org-function-name">ol</span>>
</pre>
</div>


 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-html">< <span class="org-function-name">ol</span>  <span class="org-variable-name">class</span>= <span class="org-string">"arg"</span>>
  < <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
    First Premise
  </ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
  < <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
    Last Premise
  </ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
  < <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
    Conclusion
  </ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
</ <span class="org-function-name">ol</span>>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Sometimes, the last premise is significantly shorter than the others, and the underline doesn’t look quite right. For example,
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-html">< <span class="org-function-name">ol</span>>
  < <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
    P ⊃ Q
  </ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
  < <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
    P
  </ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
  < <span class="org-function-name">li</span>  <span class="org-variable-name">style</span>= <span class="org-string">"list-style:none;"</span>>
    Q
  </ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
</ <span class="org-function-name">ol</span>>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
That can be fixed with some non-breaking spaces. It looks ugly, but it does take care of the problem.
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="org52fcb2b">
<ol>
  <li>
    P &#8835; Q
  </li>
  <li>
    <u>P&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<;/u>
  </li>
  <li style="list-style:none;">
    Q
  </li>
</ol>
</pre>

 <p>
That produces
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-html">< <span class="org-function-name">ol</span>>
  < <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
    P ⊃ Q
  </ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
  < <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
    P
  </ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
  < <span class="org-function-name">li</span>  <span class="org-variable-name">style</span>= <span class="org-string">"list-style:none;"</span>>
    Q
  </ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
</ <span class="org-function-name">ol</span>>
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</section> <section id="outline-container-markdown" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="markdown">Markdown</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-markdown">
 <p>
It is very easy to make lists in Markdown. Unfortunately, we have the same problem that we started with in HTML. That is, the conclusion is numbered:
</p>

 <ol class="org-ol"> <li>First Premise</li>
 <li>Second Premise</li>
 <li>Conclusion</li>
</ol> <p>
Since raw HTML can be used in Markdown, we could just use HTML. Since the Goldmark rendering engine that Hugo uses allows attributes and classes in Markdown, there is another, far simpler, option. First, make sure that your site config.toml page has “unsafe = true” and “block = true” in the markup section. Mine looks like this:
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="org5c407a5">
[markup]
  [markup.goldmark]
  [markup.goldmark.parser]
      autoHeadingID = true
      autoHeadingIDType = "github"
      [markup.goldmark.parser.attribute]
	block = true
	title = true
    [markup.goldmark.renderer]
      unsafe = true
</pre>

 <p>
Now, add a new class to your stylesheet. I called it “arg” and styled it like this:
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="org8408257">
.arg li:last-child {
  list-style: none;
}

.arg li:nth-last-child(2) {
text-decoration: underline;
}

.arg li {
margin: 0px;
}
</pre>

 <p>
The first part removes the number at the line with the conclusion, and the second part underlines the last premise. Finally, I decided to tighten up the lines. Now, when you write your post, just use a normal Markdown ordered list with the class after the last item:
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="orgb0b35ba">
1. First premise
2. Second premise
3. Conclusion
{.arg}
</pre>

 <p>
When published, that code produces this:
</p>

 <ol class="org-ol arg"> <li>First premise</li>
 <li>Second premise</li>
 <li>Conclusion</li>
</ol> <div class="tagline" id="org44794f1">

Lord Jesus,
</p>

 <p>
When the disciples heard your voice, <br></br>
they left everything they had <br></br>
to follow you.
</p>

 <p>
Examine our hearts, Lord, <br></br>
and show us those things that <br></br>
we also need to abandon, <br></br>
those remnants of an earthly kingdom <br></br>
That have no place in the Kingdom of God:
</p>

 <p>
The need to win,
</p>

 <p>
The need to get our way,
</p>

 <p>
Our feelings of superiority <br></br>
to our brothers and sisters,
</p>

 <p>
Our tendency to seek our own will, <br></br>
and to call it yours.
</p>

 <p>
We have muffled your voice <br></br>
in the frenzied noise <br></br>
Of modern life;
</p>

 <p>
Lest we hear, <br></br>
and, like the disciples, <br></br>
be compelled to follow.
</p>

 <p>
Yet in those occasional <br></br>
moments of stillness, <br></br>
we find that you still call.
</p>

 <p>
We pray to God <br></br>
that we can still hear.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>

  <title>Thoughts on The Fine-Tuning Argument</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Feb 14, 2019 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Thoughts on The Fine-Tuning Argument</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Feb 14, 2019 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Yesterday, Paul Gould from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary presented a very interesting talk titled, “Cultural Apologetics: Renewing the Christian Voice, Conscience, and Imagination in a Disenchanted World.” In it, he argued for two important claims:
</p>

 <ol class="org-ol"> <li>The world is fine-tuned for human life, and</li>
 <li>The world is fine-tuned for human flourishing.</li>
</ol> <p>
The argument from fine-tuning is particularly fascinating in that, as Paul rightly pointed out, everyone agrees on the data, just not on what the data shows. As I continued to think about the presentation while driving home, I realized that I can’t even agree with myself on what the data shows.
</p>
 <section id="outline-container-org4bedc2a" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="org4bedc2a">The Argument</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4bedc2a">
 <p>
The physics may be complicated, but the idea behind the argument is simple. Take a factor like the initial strength of the explosion at the Big Bang. Had the strength of that explosion differed by as little as one part in 1,060, the universe would have either collapsed back on itself, because the explosion was not strong enough to overcome the strength of gravity, or it would have expanded too fast for stars to form. So, had the force of that explosion been even slightly different, life would never have had a chance to form.
</p>

 <p>
That factor is just one of many. By some estimates there are over 100 factors, and had any one of them been just slightly different, life would have been impossible. It is difficult to conceptualize the degree of tolerance here. An accuracy of 1 in 1,060 has been compared to firing a bullet and hitting a one-inch target twenty billion light years away on the other side of the observable universe. That’s just for one factor, the probability of all of the factors having the precise values that they do must be incredibly low.
</p>

 <p>
So far, that’s nothing controversial. The universe appears to be fine-tuned for life. The controversial move is the inference from apparent fine-tuning to the probability of a fine-tuner. The intuition is that, considering the very many different ways the universe could have been, it is  <i>very unlikely</i> that we would have ended up with this world if there were no creator. On the other hand, if there were a creator, it is  <i>very likely</i> that a world capable of sustaining life would be created. Now, it becomes a Bayesian problem. Let  <i>L</i> be a life sustaining universe and  <i>D</i> be the existence of a designer, the probability of a designer given that the universe sustains life is
</p>

 <p>
\( \Pr(D \vert L) = \frac{\Pr(D) \times \Pr(L \vert D)}{\Pr (L)} \)
</p>

 <p>
The probability that there is not a designer, given a life sustaining universe is
</p>

 <p>
\( \Pr(\neg D \vert L) = \frac{\Pr(\neg D) \times \Pr(L \vert \neg D)}{\Pr (L)} \)
</p>

 <p>
Since the denominators are the same, \( \Pr(D\vert L) > \Pr(\neg D \vert L)\) if and only \( \Pr(D) \times \Pr(L \vert D) > \Pr(\neg D) \times \Pr(L \vert \neg D)\). Now, all we need to know is the prior probability of God existing, and we would know the probability of a life-sustaining universe on the assumption that there is a God. Easier said than done, as they say.
</p>

 <p>
Instead, maybe we should rethink the strategy. If I knew how each additional factor affected the probability, then I might be able to assess how low the prior probability of  <i>D</i> must be in order for the evidence to  <i>not</i> raise \( \Pr(D\vert L)\) over 0.5. To do this, we can use the odds version of Bayes’ theorem: the odds of  <i>D</i> given  <i>L</i> is equal to the prior odds of  <i>D</i> times the likelihood ratio:
</p>

 <p>
\( O(D \vert L) = O(D) \times \frac{\Pr (L \vert D)}{\Pr (L \vert \neg D}\)
</p>

 <p>
Now, let’s take that \( \frac{1}{1,060}\) tolerance from above, but let’s change it to  \(\frac{1}{1,001}\). This does two things. First, it favors atheism some, but, more importantly for me, it makes the math much easier, because it makes the likelihood ratio a nice round number:
</p>

 <p>
\( \frac{\Pr (L \vert D)}{\Pr (L \vert \neg D} = \frac{\frac{1,000}{1,001}}{\frac{1}{1,001}} = \frac{1,000}{1}\)
</p>

 <p>
That means that with each new factor, the odds of the the universe being intentionally fine-tuned increase by a factor of 1,000. With 100 factors, the odds of theism are equal to the prior odds times \(1 \times 10^{300}\). This means that, in order for it to be less likely that God exists, given apparent fine-tuning, the prior odds of God existing must be less than \(\frac{1}{10^{300}}\)
</p>

 <p>
Now, I admit that I don’t know if all the factors have the same odds. I just know that some of them have been estimated to be higher than the value that I used. So, let’s just lower the odds by a power of 100. That is, now the degree of tolerance for each factor is a mere 1 in 10. If so, then the prior odds of God existing would still have to be lower than 1 in 1,000 before it would be unlikely that theism were true.
</p>

 <p>
At some point, I’ll consider some objections and responses.

In March, I started to notice blood in my urine. At Sheri’s insistence, I made an appointment to see our family doctor. After waiting two weeks for approval from the insurance company, I was referred to a urologist, Dr. Archer in Oklahoma City. After another two weeks of waiting for approval, the urologist performed a procedure to see if anything was wrong with the bladder. He noticed tumors, and diagnosed it as an invasive bladder cancer.
</p>

 <p>
He then referred me to Dr. Stratton at the Stephenson Cancer Center at OU. Dr. Stratton scheduled the same procedure, since Dr. Archer was not able to go very deep. He told us that the treatment options were dependent on the depth of the tumor. If the tumor extended into the muscle, then the only option is to remove the bladder. If not, then the cancer is treated with BCG, the vaccine for tuberculosis.
</p>

 <p>
The results were good – I do not now need to have the bladder removed, and I have been admitted to a clinical trial of BCG. My first treatment is on Thursday, June 6.

I have often wondered how people with no insurance survive a serious illness. Now, I’m beginning to wonder how people who do have insurance can survive a serious illness. Last week, I had a small surgical procedure to determine if the bladder needed to be removed or not. Yesterday, I got an email from Aetna saying there was a response on a new claim. When I opened the site, there was a flag by the claim saying that additional information was required. When I clicked on that link, there was no description of an requested information, just a statement that, of the $19,768.45 billed by the provider, Aetna would pay $0, and I would pay the remaining $19,768.45. Why have I been paying ever more expensive premiums?

I feel a bit better today after a close reading of both the Aetna and the AFLAC policies. It seems that Aetna just wants to know if there are any other policies that could provide coverage. Why they want to know that now, but didn’t earlier, I have no idea.
</p>

 <p>
So, I am hopeful – but I’ll know when I call tomorrow.
</p>

 <p>
UPDATE: I gave the Aetna representative the number for our AFLAC policy – she confirmed that Aetna was primary and AFLAC secondary, and told me that the claims would be resubmitted. Sometimes, things go well, even when dealing with insurance.

The RN today told me a story about a 90 year old man he was supposed to take down the hall in the hospital. The man got out of bed himself and started walking down the hall in his hospital gown. The nurse ran up to him and said “Your back door is open!” The man replied, “That’s why there’s a pocket on the gown — for all the tips.”
</p>

 <p>
I won’t discuss the situation today that prompted his telling me that story though.

  <title>Thoughts on COVID-19</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Mar 19, 2020 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Thoughts on COVID-19</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Mar 19, 2020 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Here are some thoughts as I reflect on comments about, and available data on, the COVID-19 coronavirus.
</p>

 <p>
I have seen some posts pointing out that 700 million people contracted H1N1 Swine Flue without any schools or businesses closing. The posts then go on to infer that COVID-19 has been “over-hyped.” There are several things to note as people decide how to appropriately respond to the pandemic, using the best numbers that I can find. H1N1 was indeed a serious pandemic, but the 700 million infected is not the only important number. H1N1 resulted in 150,000 fatalities (both of these numbers are minimum estimates), so the mortality rate for H1N1 was a mere 0.02%.
</p>

 <p>
The mortality rate for COVID-19 is difficult to estimate, mainly because of the lack of adequate testing. Accurately estimating the mortality rate requires not only a decent estimate of the number of deaths from the infection, but also a good estimate of the total number of people infected. Without readily available tests, the tendency is to underestimate the number of people infected, which leads to an overestimation of the mortality rate. Early estimates were around 2%, then quickly rose to 3.4%, but now appear to be decreasing with more data. The best data comes from countries that tested a higher percentage of residents. So far, only 7 of every million residents of the U.S. have been tested, but South Korea’s rate of testing was over 150 times that of the U.S. The mortality rate in South Korea was only 0.6%, far lower than the estimates that we are hearing.
</p>

 <p>
Good news for the COVID-19 skeptics? Not really, 0.6% is far lower than 2%, but it is 30 times greater than the mortality rate for H1N1. Even more important, we should only expect to have the 0.6% rate if we take the same steps as South Korea, which immediately set up a central disaster headquarters for a uniform and consistent response across the country, and ordered all schools from kindergarten through high school to postpone their spring semester. The mortality rate for Italy, also a country with a high testing percentage, is much higher. So far, the response to COVID-19 in the United States seems to be more like Italy than South Korea.
</p>

 <p>
We should also compare COVID-19 to the SARS coronavirus. SARS killed 774 people in 2003, out of 8,096 known cases. The mortality rate for SARS, then, was a staggering 10%. Does that make SARS worse than COVID-19? We should keep in mind that there were only 8,096 known cases; there have now been over 45,000 known recoveries from COVID-19. The infection rate seems to be far, far greater with COVID-19.
</p>

 <p>
Rational risk assessment is a function of two factors: the probability of harm and the degree of harm. Coronavirus wins the risk assessment game compared with both SARS and H1N1. The infection rate is far greater than that of SARS, and the mortality rate is far greater than that of H1N1.
</p>

 <p>
Still, these numbers don’t apply to every population group. The mortality rate in China for children under 10 was 0%, for non-geriatric adults, it was 0.2–0.4%. The rates appear to significantly increase at 70 to 1.1%, then to 4.9% for those over 80. So, most of us have little or nothing to fear for ourselves from COVID-19, but those in high-risk groups, including the elderly and those with compromised immune systems, may have much to fear. The best way to save those people is to do everything we can to minimize the spreading of the virus, not just to them, but to anyone with whom they may have contact. The experience of other countries shows us that this requires these measures that motivate those negative social media posts.
</p>

 <p>
There are those, not in high-risk groups, who may ask, “Why should we change our lifestyles if we are not personally at risk? Isn’t that just giving in to fear?” The answer is simple, we do these things not out of fear, but out of love for our neighbor.

  <title>Emacs Org-Capture</title>

  <summary>May 12, 2020 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Emacs Org-Capture</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">May 12, 2020 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
When trying to post to a journal for the first time in an embarrassing number of months, I received an error that I had never had in the past: “org-capture-select-template: Symbol’s function definition is void: org-mks.” A quick search revealed that it’s clearly defined in org.el, and I was successfully using org mode for other things, so I could see no reason for the error. A Google search revealed that several had the problem, but none of the proposed solutions worked.
</p>

 <p>
In the end, it was a problem with my Emacs initialization file. I use an org-mode file, that is bootstrapped with an initialization file that requires org-install and tangle. Moving (package-initialize) to the first line of that file fixed the problem.

  <title>Beamer Presentations with Org Mode</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jun 01, 2020 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Beamer Presentations with Org Mode</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jun 01, 2020 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
When we moved all courses online for the semester because of the COVID-19 pandemic, I found myself having to make many more presentation slide-decks than I normally do, especially when I normally don’t do any at all. Keynote produces some beautiful slides, but it requires using the mouse more than I like. I wanted something that I could use to make slides with just a few keystrokes. I settled on exporting an Org mode document to Beamer slides. This is an explanation of the challenges that I had and the solutions that I found.
</p>
 <section id="outline-container-org370b7f0" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="org370b7f0">Beamer</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org370b7f0">
 <p>
The Beamer class is a tool used to produce presentations with LaTeX. It provides the same advantages for presentations that standard LaTeX provides for other document types, including elegant mathematical formulas, transportability between computing platforms, and the ability focus on content when writing. There are disadvantages, though. Writing LaTeX can be cumbersome, since it is not a simple markup language. After gaining a certain proficiency, it is possible to write it fairly easily. Even so, it is never as simple as using something like Markdown.
</p>
</div>
</section> <section id="outline-container-org4ed8cc9" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="org4ed8cc9">Solution</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4ed8cc9">
 <p>
The solution that I found was Org mode, a very powerful system that includes a simple markup language and the ability to export to LaTeX. Producing the slide deck was easy, and there were many great examples online. Producing an article was also easy, again with great examples. Producing both a slide presentation and an article, using the same contents file should have been easy, since the official guide to Beamer explains how to do that in LaTeX. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find much guidance on how to do this with Org Mode. The only article I could find was this on the official  <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/exporters/beamer/beamer-dual-format.html">Org mode site</a>. It seemed too complicated to me, and I was tempted to just go back to directly writing LaTeX. I decided to try anyway, but I quickly ran into a series of problems:
</p>

 <ol class="org-ol"> <li>The Org Beamer export automatically inserted a title slide with  <code>\maketitle</code>. Unfortunately, using the same content for the presentation and notes requires using the  <code>ignorenonframetext</code> switch in the document class declaration. Since the export didn’t place the command in a frame, there was no title slide.</li>
 <li>I attempted to fix this by beginning the contents file with a title-less frame that included the  <code>\maketitle</code> command. That generated a title page, but it came  <i>after</i> the table of contents slide.</li>
 <li>The article export did not treat headings correctly, and failed to recognize the Beamer-specific commands.</li>
</ol> <p>
This was enough to make me want to scrap the project, especially when I looked at the site linked above. The author fixed the title issue by hacking the Beamer export file, something that I certainly didn’t want to do. So, as is often the case, after hours of searching for solutions, I began to wonder if the solution could be much simpler than I (or anyone else, it seems) was thinking.
</p>
</div>
</section> <section id="outline-container-orgb1a5901" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="orgb1a5901">Details</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb1a5901">
 <p>
I’ll spare any reader the record of attempts, mistakes, other attempts, more mistakes, etc., and just get to the final workflow. I wrote a small script (in my case a function in Fish) that creates three files. One for the presentation, one for the article, and one for shared content. After creating the files, it opens a Dired buffer of the relevant folder in Emacs.
</p>

 <p>
For those who use the Fish shell, here is the function:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-shell"> <span class="org-keyword">function</span>  <span class="org-function-name">lecture</span>
    touch {$ <span class="org-variable-name">argv</span>}.org
     <span class="org-builtin">echo</span> -e  <span class="org-string">'#+startup: beamer'</span> \n <span class="org-string">'#+TITLE: '</span> \n <span class="org-string">'#+AUTHOR: Dr. Ridenour'</span> \n <span class="org-string">'#+DATE: '</span> >>{$ <span class="org-variable-name">argv</span>}.org
    touch {$ <span class="org-variable-name">argv</span>}-beamer.org
    cat /Users/rlridenour/Dropbox/emacs/beamer/lecture-beamer.org >{$ <span class="org-variable-name">argv</span>}-beamer.org
     <span class="org-builtin">echo</span> -e  <span class="org-string">'#+include: "'</span>{$ <span class="org-variable-name">argv</span>} <span class="org-string">'.org" :minlevel 1'</span> >>{$ <span class="org-variable-name">argv</span>}-beamer.org
    touch {$ <span class="org-variable-name">argv</span>}-notes.org
    cat /Users/rlridenour/Dropbox/emacs/beamer/lecture-notes.org >{$ <span class="org-variable-name">argv</span>}-notes.org
     <span class="org-builtin">echo</span> -e  <span class="org-string">'#+include: "'</span>{$ <span class="org-variable-name">argv</span>} <span class="org-string">'.org" :minlevel 1'</span> >>{$ <span class="org-variable-name">argv</span>}-notes.org
    dired
end 
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
So, entering “lecture kant” in the shell will open a Dired buffer containg the files kant.org, kant-beamer.org, and kant-notes.org.
</p>
</div>
 <div id="outline-container-org38dc48c" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="org38dc48c">Contents File</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org38dc48c">
 <p>
The contents file is a standard org file. Initially, I had it containing nothing in the header, except for possibly one line containing `#+startup: beamer`, which makes it easier to insert some Beamer-specific commands. After getting tired of entering the same data twice in the other files, I wondered if shared header information could just be placed in the contents file. Occasionally things work exactly how hoped they would, so no the function adds the following lines at the top of the contents file:
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="org3673287">
#+startup: beamer
#+TITLE:
#+AUTHOR: Dr. Ridenour
#+DATE: 
</pre>

 <p>
You will need to decide what heading level will designate a slide. Don’t worry, you’ll still be able to use that heading level in the article, as I’ll explain later. I use h3, so slides begin with a line like this in the contents file:
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="orgc9f11c0">
*** Slide Title
</pre>

 <p>
To add notes, you need to structurally separate the note content, which should only be printed on the article, from the preceding slide. To do this, add another h3 heading (I creatively title it “Notes”) with instructions to ignore the heading:
</p>


 <pre class="example" id="orgccd1115">
*** Notes :B_ignoreheading:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
:END:
</pre>

 <p>
Any text that follows will only appear in the article, not in the presentation. This does not have to be done for every successive note paragraph, it only needs to be done after a slide. So, any paragraphs that are in the scope of an h1 or h2 heading won’t need that.
</p>
</div>
</div>
 <div id="outline-container-org29220dc" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="org29220dc">Presentation File</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org29220dc">
 <p>
The magic happens with two small files. The first is the presentation file. At the top, put your preferred Beamer export header, but be sure to include  <code>#+latex_CLASS_options: [ignorenonframetext]</code> and  <code>#+OPTIONS: toc:nil</code> . The latter is to ensure that Beamer export doesn’t make the contents slide before the presentation title slide. Then, make the title page like this:
</p>


 <pre class="example" id="org5c00a72">
***
\maketitle 
</pre>


 <p>
If you want a table of contents slide, you can do the same thing except use `\tableofcontents`. Finally, include the contents file with this line:
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="org832cb42">
#+include: "contents.org" :minlevel 1 
</pre>

 <p>
I keep the header information in two files in Dropbox. The Fish function adds the header, the title and table of contents lines, and the link to the contents file 
</p>
</div>
</div>
 <div id="outline-container-orgd49fefd" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="orgd49fefd">Article File</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd49fefd">
 <p>
For the article, use your preferred header with all of the packages declared, but be sure to add this line:  <code>#+latex_HEADER: \usepackage{beamerarticle}</code>. After the export header lines, include the contents file, again using `#+include: “contents.org” :minlevel 1`. When exporting, be sure to export with the one of the Beamer-specific exports. Otherwise, things just won’t look right.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</section> <section id="outline-container-orgfd3b71b" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="orgfd3b71b">Conclusion</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfd3b71b">
 <p>
There is one remaining problem that I have: the verse environment won’t work in beamerarticle. That’s a relatively small problem, though. I’m certainly not an Org mode expert, so if anyone has questions or suggestions, please let me know. I hope this saves at least one person some time.

Reading  <a href="https://twitter.com/thedocfile/status/1288116751083790339?s=20">this tweet</a> by Luke Dockery prompted some thoughts on uses of the terms ’liberal’ and ’conservative’.
</p>

 <p>
Claims like “racism has deeply-rooted, ongoing effects” and “masks are helpful in limiting the spread of COVID” are true or false, not liberal or conservative. Assuming realism, the position that reality is what it is, independent of our beliefs, desires, etc., believing one of these claims does not, in itself, make a person either liberal or conservative, but only right or wrong with respect to the relevant facts.
</p>

 <p>
Uses of the terms, ’liberal’ and ’conservative’ seem to me to be so different now than what they traditionally were, that I’m not sure what they even mean anymore. Maybe it’s best to think of them as frameworks of fundamental commitments used to justify normative claims about political structures. If so, what makes one a liberal or conservative is not so much the normative beliefs that are held, but the reasons one has for holding those beliefs.
</p>

 <p>
I’m confident that there are normative claims that are logically incompatible with a given set of reasons, but it’s important to understand that many normative claims can be justified on several different sets of reasons. So, both a conservative can reasonably believe something that is traditionally associated with liberalism, but believe it for different reasons than a liberal might. A good example is the belief that we should preserve the environment. A traditionally conservative reason for environmentalism would be the commitment to a Burkean social contract that includes, not just the present generation, but past and future ones as well, such that no single generation is a tyrant over others.
</p>

 <p>
A rational conservative is unlikely to ever advocate abolishing the police, because another traditional central conservative doctrine is a commitment to established laws and institutions, insofar as they have served us well in the past. A conservative could, however, advocate “defunding” the police, on some proposed meanings of defunding — that is, making changes to existing police forces insofar as they have not served us well. (I grant that ’defunding’ is an unfortunate term, but to assume that everyone means “completely defunding”, especially when it has been made clear that they do not, is to commit a straw man fallacy.)
</p>

 <p>
That means that, for most normative claims, one cannot know if a person who holds them is a liberal or conservative unless one knows the reasons for which the claims are believed. Which means that inferences like “You believe X, therefore you are a Z” are rarely, if ever, examples of good reasoning. What is needed is “You believe X for the reason that Y, therefore you are a Z.” Unfortunately, even when we reason like this, the reasons are often simply attributed to the interlocutor, not gained from them in dialogue. A memorable line from a former colleague is relevant here: “Labels are libel.”
</p>

 <p>
For non-normative claims, like the ones above about racism and the use of masks, the important question is not whether holding them makes one a conservative or liberal. The important question is whether they are true. Our responses to the facts may be liberal or conservative, but the facts themselves are neither. So, in both cases, the normative and the non-normative, the reasonable thing to do when a person claims something is not to immediately label them, the reasonable thing to do is to engage in dialogue, to discover the reasons, or evidence, for the claim.
</p>

 <p>
What is going on when a person says, “You believe X, therefore you are a Z”? I can think of three possibilities, ranging from the best to the worst, although none are good:
</p>

 <ol class="org-ol"> <li>It is a charge of cognitive bias. There is no doubt that features of our particular psychologies, such as our beliefs, desires, emotional attitudes, etc., incline us to believe certain things. We consider these things to be cognitive biases to the extent that they incline us to believe falsehoods. So, again, the important question is not, ultimately, what biases tend to result in this belief, but whether the belief is true. Even more, imagine that you believe something only because you are biased to do so. That, in itself, does not give me good reason to dismiss your belief as false. Just because you have no good reasons for the belief does not imply that there are no good reasons for it. (Incidentally, one of the best ways to diminish the role that our biases are playing is to engage in honest, open dialogue with people who disagree with us.)</li>
 <li>It is a case of an ad hominem fallacy. “Since you believe X, you are a Z, and I shouldn’t believe anything that a Z says, include your claim of X.” Dismissing someone’s belief by labeling the person as a liberal or conservative is an often persuasive ad hominem, but it is an hominem nonetheless. Ad hominems have their usefulness, however, especially when one doesn’t have good evidence for one’s own position.</li>
 <li>A third reason for dismissing a claim as false by labeling the speaker as liberal or conservative is because it’s simply not the way I want the world to be. This, unfortunately, seems to me to be more and more common. Consider one of the claims above, “masks are helpful in limiting the spread of COVID.” Evaluating a hypothesis is a function of two things, initial plausibility and confirmation by evidence. I’ll go out on a limb here and say that any reasonable person should assess the initial plausibility of the claim as very high for two reasons. First, it’s a relatively weak claim — it does not claim that mask-wearing completely prevents COVID, but only that it is helpful in limiting its spread. Second, COVID is a respiratory disease; does it not make sense that wearing masks covering our noses and mouths would limit the spread of respiratory diseases? If not, then why cover our mouths when we sneeze, simply because it is polite? A high initial plausibility of a hypothesis does not guarantee that the hypothesis is true, but it does mean that greater evidence would be required to show that it is false. So, responses like, “this can’t be true, because one respectable scientist is saying that…” or “this can’t be true, becuase there is one study showing that…” are simply not enough. It strikes me as more likely that claims like this are rejected because we simply don’t like the inconvenience of wearing masks. This, however, is a kind of naïve anti-realism, demanding that the world conform to the way I want it to be. This is especially unfortunate for conservatives, for one thing that conservatives formerly prided themselves on was their commitment to realism, by recognizing that we have to deal with the world as it is, not simply the world as we want it to be.</li>
</ol> <p>
A final point: it is useful to be able to sort beliefs, positions, etc. into typological categories. Such categories help us to predict behavior and better understand each other. It’s important to realize that these categories, though, are simply models, and that models are, at best, approximations of the landscape of reality, and, as approximations, will always have exceptions. Once those category terms become pejoratives, it strikes me that they are no longer useful for anything except for asserting power — the power to create a world that conforms to my desires, or the power to make others believe what I want them to, regardless of the evidence. The first is not a power that we finite beings have. The second is something we might have, but shouldn’t exercise.

  <title>Styled Pages in Canvas</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <h1 class="title">Styled Pages in Canvas
 <br></br> <span class="subtitle">Jun 29, 2021 00:00</span>
</h1>
 <p>
My  <a href="2019-01-08-arguments-html.html">method</a> of formatting philosophical arguments in HTML works fine when writing web pages on my own site, but not so well when I don’t have access to the site’s CSS, or so I thought. I tell students to format arguments in what is usually called “standard form” — a list with numbered premises and a line separating the premises from the conclusion. So, it should look like this:
</p>

 <ol class="org-ol arg"> <li>First premise</li>
 <li>Second premise</li>
 <li>Conclusion</li>
</ol> <p>
This is simple to do in LaTeX with this:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-tex"> <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\begin</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">enumerate</span>}
 <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\item</span></span> First Premise
 <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\item</span></span>  <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\underline</span></span>{ <span class="org-font-latex-underline">Last Premise</span>}
 <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\item</span></span> [] Conclusion
 <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\end</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">enumerate</span>}
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
As I explained  <a href="2019-01-08-arguments-html.html">earlier</a>, it’s also easy to in HTML by declaring a CSS class. Unfortunately, I see nowhere in Canvas, the learning management system used by our university, to put an external style sheet. So, my options seemed to be, first, to put the premises in a list and the conclusion on a separate line following the list. That would produce something like this:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-html">< <span class="org-function-name">ol</span>>
    < <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>First premise</ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
    < <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>< <span class="org-function-name">u</span>> <span class="org-underline">Second premise</span></ <span class="org-function-name">u</span>></ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
</ <span class="org-function-name">ol</span>>
</pre>
</div>



 <p>
Conclusion
</p>

 <p>
The premises are fine, but the conclusion is a new paragraph. A better option would be to put the conclusion as a numbered item in the list:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-html">< <span class="org-function-name">ol</span>>
< <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>First premise</ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
< <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>< <span class="org-function-name">u</span>> <span class="org-underline">Second premise</span></ <span class="org-function-name">u</span>></ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
< <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>Conclusion</ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
</ <span class="org-function-name">ol</span>>
</pre>
</div>


 <p>
This looks better, although I don’t really like the separation between the list items. Unfortunately, since the conclusion is also numbered, it’s easy to mistake the conclusion for another premise.
</p>

 <p>
The best option seemed to be to produce handouts as PDF’s with LaTeX. They would be formatted correctly, but difficult to read on small mobile devices. Still, there had to be a better way. Pages in Canvas are just HTML documents, although the rich text editor hides the code from most users. There is an option to use an HTML editor when editing a page, though. My first thought was to reference an external style sheet in a document head in the usual way, like this:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-html">< <span class="org-keyword">!doctype</span> html>
< <span class="org-function-name">html</span>>
        < <span class="org-function-name">head</span>>
                < <span class="org-function-name">link</span>  <span class="org-variable-name">rel</span>= <span class="org-string">"stylesheet"</span>  <span class="org-variable-name">href</span>= <span class="org-string">"mystyle.css"</span>>
                < <span class="org-function-name">meta</span>  <span class="org-variable-name">charset</span>= <span class="org-string">"utf-8"</span> />
        </ <span class="org-function-name">head</span>>
        < <span class="org-function-name">body</span>>
                < <span class="org-function-name">ol</span>  <span class="org-variable-name">class</span>= <span class="org-string">"arg"</span>>
                        < <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>First premise</ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
                        < <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>Second premise</ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
                        < <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>Conclusion</ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
                </ <span class="org-function-name">ol</span>>
        </ <span class="org-function-name">body</span>>
</ <span class="org-function-name">html</span>>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
That would have been nice and simple, if it had worked. I then tried internal CSS:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-html">< <span class="org-keyword">!doctype</span> html>
< <span class="org-function-name">html</span>>
        < <span class="org-function-name">head</span>>
                < <span class="org-function-name">meta</span>  <span class="org-variable-name">charset</span>= <span class="org-string">"utf-8"</span> />
                < <span class="org-function-name">style</span>>
                 .arg li:last-child {list-style: none;}
                 .arg li:nth-last-child(2) {text-decoration: underline;}
                 .arg li {margin: 0px;}
                </ <span class="org-function-name">style</span>>
        </ <span class="org-function-name">head</span>>
        < <span class="org-function-name">body</span>>
                < <span class="org-function-name">ol</span>  <span class="org-variable-name">class</span>= <span class="org-string">"arg"</span>>
                        < <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>First premise</ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
                        < <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>Second premise</ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
                        < <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>Conclusion</ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
                </ <span class="org-function-name">ol</span>>
        </ <span class="org-function-name">body</span>>
</ <span class="org-function-name">html</span>>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Success! That is, until I clicked “Edit” again, and Canvas stripped away everything outside the body tags. Finally, I tried inline CSS:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-html">< <span class="org-function-name">ol</span>  <span class="org-variable-name">class</span>= <span class="org-string">"arg"</span>>
        < <span class="org-function-name">li</span>  <span class="org-variable-name">style</span>= <span class="org-string">"margin: 0px;"</span>>First premise</ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
        < <span class="org-function-name">li</span>  <span class="org-variable-name">style</span>= <span class="org-string">"margin: 0px; text-decoration: underline;"</span>>Second premise</ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
        < <span class="org-function-name">li</span>  <span class="org-variable-name">style</span>= <span class="org-string">"margin: 0px; list-style: none;"</span>>Conclusion</ <span class="org-function-name">li</span>>
</ <span class="org-function-name">ol</span>>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
That finally worked. Unfortunately, it meant that the CSS had to be explicitly declared on every item that needed styling, every time that the item was used on the page. Then, I discovered CSS Inliners. An inliner is a tool that takes externally styled HTML as input, and outputs HTML with all inline CSS. Evidently, these are used by people who want to control the formatting of their HTML emails.  <a href="https://templates.mailchimp.com/resources/inline-css/">Mailchimp’s Inline Tool</a> works well. I’m using an inliner tool called “Juice” that can be installed using the Node package manager. That way, I can automate the process with a simple shell script. Here’s the function I use in  <a href="https://templates.mailchimp.com/resources/inline-css/">fish</a>:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-shell"> <span class="org-keyword">function</span>  <span class="org-function-name">canvas</span>
        juice canvas.html canvas.html
        find . -type f -name  <span class="org-string">"canvas.html"</span> -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i  <span class="org-string">''</span> -e  <span class="org-string">'s/body>/div>/g'</span>
        pbcopy <  <span class="org-string">"canvas.html"</span>
        rm canvas.html
end
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Line 2 runs the inliner on a file named “canvas.html” and overwrites that file. Line 3 changes the body tags to div tags, which prevents Canvas from deleting any text outside the body tags. Finally, line 3 copies the resulting file to the clipboard, ready to be pasted into the Canvas HTML editor, and line 4 then deletes the HTML file. I delete the HTML file, because, since I use Emacs, the handouts themselves are written in Org mode. So, any changes are made to the Org document, which would then need to be exported again to HTML. The Org document header contains these lines:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-orgmode">#+AUTHOR: Randy Ridenour
#+LANGUAGE: en-us
#+EXPORT_FILE_NAME: canvas.html
#+HTML_DOCTYPE: html5
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil
#+OPTIONS: html-style:nil
#+HTML_HEAD: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://randyridenour.net/css/canvas.css"/>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Line 3 ensures that the output file is named  <code>canvas.html</code>. That makes the shell script easier to write, and it doesn’t need a unique name since it will just be deleted immediately after being copied to the clipboard. Line 5 prevents a table of contents from being generated. If the handout is long enough to warrant a TOC, then just change that to  <code>toc:true</code>. Line 6 prevents the Org exporter from adding its usual CSS, and line 7 adds the reference to an external stylesheet located on my personal website.
</p>

 <p>
Everything is tied together with a very simple Emacs function:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-elisp">( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">canvas-copy</span> ()
   <span class="org-doc">"Copy html for canvas pages"</span>
  ( <span class="org-keyword">interactive</span>)
  (org-html-export-to-html)
  (shell-command  <span class="org-string">"canvas"</span>)
)
</pre>
</div>

Like most Emacs users, I tend to use Org Mode as much as I can. Hugo has native support for Org files, but it’s not as thorough as I would like. It seems that most people who blog using Emacs and Hugo use Ox-Hugo to export their Org files to the Markdown format that is best supported by Hugo. I’ll experiment with some test posts over the next few days, then come back and post my thoughts.

  <title>Workflow with Hugo and Org Mode</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Workflow with Hugo and Org Mode</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jul 14, 2021 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Setting up the  <a href="https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo">Ox-hugo</a> package to use Org mode with Hugo was much easier than I expected. Here is how I configured it, the workflow for posting with Doom Emacs, and some things to keep in mind.
</p>
 <section id="outline-container-orgd2c7bef" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="orgd2c7bef">Installation and configuration</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd2c7bef">
 <p>
I’m back to using Doom Emacs, so adding Ox-hugo required nothing more than adding the  <code>+hugo</code> flag to  <code>:lang org</code> in the init.el file. Look for  <code>org</code> in init.el, and change it to  <code>(org +hugo)</code>. Ox-hugo has excellent  <a href="https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/">documentation</a>, and I configured it almost exactly the way that was suggested. I was skeptical that having a single Org file that contained every blog post was a good idea, but after two days, it seems to be the way to go. I have a file called “blog.org” in a directory named “content-org” in my hugo project directory. This file has the following settings at the top:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-org"> <span class="org-org-meta-line">#+hugo_base_dir: ~/Sites/blog</span>
 <span class="org-org-meta-line">#+seq_todo: TODO DRAFT DONE</span>
 <span class="org-org-meta-line">#+hugo_front_matter_format: yaml</span>
 <span class="org-org-meta-line">#+hugo_weight: auto</span>
 <span class="org-org-meta-line">#+hugo_auto_set_lastmod: t</span>
 <span class="org-org-document-info-keyword">#+author:</span>  <span class="org-org-document-info">Randy Ridenour</span>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Then, there is a top-level heading called “Blog Ideas”. All other top-level headings are categories. Each second-level heading will be a post under that particular category.
</p>

 <p>
Next, <I copied the Org-capture template and made some small modifications. I changed  <code>EXPORT_FILE_NAME</code> to format file names with a date string to match my other post file names. I also included a line with some custom front matter that I usually use, mostly because I know I wouldn’t remember how to insert it when I needed i>
</p>

 <p>
Here is the template:

 <code>C-c n n</code> in Doom opens a hydra for Org-capture. Selecting “h” prompts for a post title in the minibuffer. Enter the title, press the return key, and a new Org-mode window opens with the file settings from the capture template. Enter the desired text, then press  <code>C-c C-c</code> to close the window. The post is filed in the site’s Org content file under the Blog Ideas section. When ready, move the cursor to a point in the post, and use org-refile to put it in the category that you would like.
</p>

 <p>
Add a file called “dir-locals.el” to the root level of the hugo site directory that has this content:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(( <span class="org-string">"content-org/"</span>
  . ((org-mode . ((eval . (org-hugo-auto-export-mode)))))))
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Then, as you write your posts, you can preview them at localhost:1313 as you edit them; just start the Hugo server in your terminal application like this:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-bash">hugo server -D --navigateToChanged
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Now, every the Org file is saved, it automatically exports the correctly formatted Markdown post to the “content/posts” directory, and Hugo serves up the changed post in your browser.
</p>

 <p>
When the draft is finished, change the  <code>TODO</code> flag in the post title to  <code>DONE</code>, and the date will be updated.
</p>
</div>
</section> <section id="outline-container-orgaf8ac2f" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="orgaf8ac2f">Miscellaneous discoveries</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgaf8ac2f">
 <p>
So far, I’ve found two things to keep in mind. First, headings in the Markdown files will be one level above the headings in the Org file. So, an H2 in the Org file is the post title, sections of the post have a H3 heading. The three stars in the Org file become two octothorpes in the Markdown file.
</p>

 <p>
Second, to specify a CSS class, just put this on the line directly preceding the item needing styling:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-org"> <span class="org-org-meta-line">#+attr_html: :class classname</span>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
For example, here’s how I use my style for philosophical arguments.
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-org"> <span class="org-org-meta-line">#+attr_html: :class arg</span>
1. First premise
2. Second premise
3. Conclusion
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
produces this:
</p>

 <ol class="org-ol arg"> <li>First premise</li>
 <li>Second premise</li>
 <li>Conclusion</li>
</ol></div>
</section> <section id="outline-container-org16046e4" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="org16046e4">Conclusion</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org16046e4">
 <p>
Ox-hugo works amazingly well for producing well-formed Hugo Goldmark markdown from an Org mode source file. Since I write nearly everything in Org mode, this enables me to easily use the same material for posts, handouts, and other formats.

  <title>Abbreviate Path to iCloud Files in Emacs</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jul 18, 2021 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Abbreviate Path to iCloud Files in Emacs</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jul 18, 2021 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
When I include everything I do over my breaks in summer and January, I probably work more from my home computer than I do my office computer. A good file synchronization service makes that much easier. For years, I really only used Dropbox, and it served my needs very well. Just like the 20 MB (as in megabytes, not a typo) hard drive that I had in my first PC, it seemed like I would never run out of Dropbox space. Two problems eventually occurred. First, I did indeed reach the limit of my free tier. Second, Dropbox began enforcing a limit on the number of different devices that could sync with the free tier. I wasn’t inclined to pay for more space, because, I was already paying for extra space in iCloud for photo syncing. So, I decided to move my working documents from Dropbox to iCloud, which has worked great except for one small thing. Here is the full path and filename for one of my typical files:
</p>

 <p>
 <code>/Users/rlridenour/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/teaching/critical-thinking/notes/probabability-presentation.tex</code>
</p>

 <p>
This line is 136 characters long, and unless I expanded the size of the Emacs frame to at least half of the size of my 32-inch desktop monitor, I couldn’t see the filename in the recent files list.
</p>

 <p>
Adding this to my Doom Emacs config solved the problem:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">( <span class="org-keyword">use-package</span> ivy-rich
   <span class="org-builtin">:after</span> counsel
   <span class="org-builtin">:config</span>
  ( <span class="org-keyword">setq</span> ivy-rich-display-transformers-list
        (plist-put ivy-rich-display-transformers-list
'counsel-buffer-or-recentf
    '( <span class="org-builtin">:columns</span>
      ((counsel-buffer-or-recentf-transformer ( <span class="org-builtin">:width</span> ( <span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> (x) (ivy-rich-switch-buffer-shorten-path x (ivy-rich-minibuffer-width 1.0))))))))))
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Now, when I run  <code>counsel-buffer-or-recentf</code>, Emacs abbreviates enough of the file paths to make each line fit into the frame. How much is abbreviated depends on how large the frame is. No matter how narrow the frame, though, I can still see the filename.
</p>

  <title>Org Export to PDF with Arara</title>

I switched from latexmk to  <a href="https://mirrors.concertpass.com/tex-archive/support/arara/doc/arara-quickstart.pdf">arara</a> for compiling LaTeX files. I like being able to embed the compilation steps into the document. That way, I can run the same command to compile, but use PDFLaTeX on some and LuaLaTeX on others. Org mode’s export to PDF uses latexmk, though. I think I managed to set it to arara with this:

  <title>LaTeX Compilation Scripts</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jun 09, 2022 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">LaTeX Compilation Scripts</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jun 09, 2022 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
I’m trying to automate LaTeX compilation from Emacs as much as I can. Here are the shell scripts and Emacs functions that I’m using.
</p>
 <section id="outline-container-org0386364" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="org0386364">Shell Scripts</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0386364">
 <p>
Here are some very simple scripts for compiling LaTeX files with arara and the fish shell. The first, called “mkt” for “make TeX”, runs arara on the source file, then opens the resulting PDF.
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-nil">function mkt 
  arara $argv 
  set output_file (string replace -r tex\$ pdf $argv) 
  open -g $output_file 
end
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
The second, called “mktc” for “make TeX continuously”, runs arara, opens the PDF, watches for changes, and runs arara whenever the file is saved.
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-fish"> <span class="org-keyword">function</span>  <span class="org-function-name">mktc</span>
   <span class="org-builtin">arara</span>  <span class="org-string">$</span> <span class="org-variable-name">argv</span>
   <span class="org-keyword">set</span>  <span class="org-variable-name">output_file</span> ( <span class="org-builtin">string</span> replace -r tex <span class="org-negation-char">\</span>$ pdf  <span class="org-string">$</span> <span class="org-variable-name">argv</span>)
   <span class="org-builtin">open</span> -g  <span class="org-string">$</span> <span class="org-variable-name">output_file</span>
   <span class="org-builtin">fswatch</span> -o  <span class="org-string">$</span> <span class="org-variable-name">argv</span>  <span class="org-negation-char">|</span>  <span class="org-builtin">xargs</span> -n1 -I{} arara  <span class="org-string">$</span> <span class="org-variable-name">argv</span>
 <span class="org-keyword">end</span>
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</section> <section id="outline-container-orge665164" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="orge665164">Emacs</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge665164">
 <p>
Here are some functions to use in Emacs to run the scripts.
</p>
</div>
 <div id="outline-container-org26bd7fe" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="org26bd7fe">Auctex</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org26bd7fe">
 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">rlr/tex-mkt</span> ()
   <span class="org-doc">"Compile with arara."</span>
  ( <span class="org-keyword">interactive</span>)
  (async-shell-command (concat  <span class="org-string">"mkt "</span> (buffer-file-name))))

( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">rlr/tex-mktc</span> ()
   <span class="org-doc">"Compile continuously with arara."</span>
  ( <span class="org-keyword">interactive</span>)
  (start-process-shell-command (concat  <span class="org-string">"mktc-"</span> (buffer-file-name)) (concat  <span class="org-string">"mktc-"</span> (buffer-file-name)) (concat  <span class="org-string">"mktc "</span> (buffer-file-name))))
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
The first compiles with an asynchronous shell command, so that you can immediately return to editing the file while arara runs. I decided to use  <code>start-process-shell-command</code> instead of  <code>async-shell-command</code> for  <code>mktc</code>, since  <code>mkt</code> runs once and stops, while  <code>mktc</code> keeps running in the background. When  <code>rlr/tex-mktc</code> is called, a process is started that has the same name as the file with “mktc-” prepended it to it. The process is shown in a buffer that has the same name. That way, several files can be compiled at the same time.
</p>
</div>
</div>
 <div id="outline-container-org3ee195c" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="org3ee195c">Org Mode</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3ee195c">
 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">
( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">rlr/org-mkt</span> ()
   <span class="org-doc">"Make PDF with Arara."</span>
  ( <span class="org-keyword">interactive</span>)
  (org-latex-export-to-latex)
  (async-shell-command (concat  <span class="org-string">"mkt "</span> (file-name-sans-extension (buffer-file-name)) <span class="org-string">".tex"</span>)))

( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">rlr/org-mktc</span> ()
   <span class="org-doc">"Compile continuously with arara."</span>
  ( <span class="org-keyword">interactive</span>)
  (org-latex-export-to-latex)
  (start-process-shell-command (concat  <span class="org-string">"mktc-"</span> (buffer-file-name)) (concat  <span class="org-string">"mktc-"</span> (buffer-file-name)) (concat  <span class="org-string">"mktc "</span> (file-name-sans-extension (buffer-file-name)) <span class="org-string">".tex"</span>)))
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
These functions first export the org file to LaTeX, then compile the corresponding TeX files. All in all, a morning’s worth of work to save a few keystrokes. I run them using  <a href="https://github.com/jerrypnz/major-mode-hydra.el">major mode hydras</a>.

We had our annual Reformation Sunday gathering at the local German restaurant. My church doesn’t count itself in the Reformed tradition, but we will take any excuse to get together for good food and drink.

  <title>Arara and Latexmk</title>

Compiling LaTeX documents can be a chore, especially if the document has a table of contents, bibliographic references, cross-references, or labels. Getting the final output an be up to a four-step process:
</p>

 <ol class="org-ol"> <li>Run pdflatex to to create the labels, table of contents, and undefined bibliographic references.</li>
 <li>Run bibtex or biber to get the relevant bibliographic data from the bib files.</li>
 <li>Run pdflatex to put that bibliographic data into the document</li>
 <li>Run pdflatex again to fix any page numbers that need to change because of the new material.</li>
</ol> <section id="outline-container-org1a56182" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="org1a56182">Latexmk</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1a56182">
 <p>
Using Latexmk is a great way to automate all of this. Latexmk will do all of these steps as needed, you just need to tell what engine to use (pdflatex, lualatex, xelatex) and whether to run Bibtex or Biber. A pdfLaTeX document named “sample.tex” containing bibliographic references would be compiled from the command line like this:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-shell">latexmk -pdflatex -bibtex sample.tex
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
There are many other options that can be used, making the command to compile even longer. Fortunately, these options can all be set in a latexmkrc file.

$ <span class="org-variable-name">clean_ext</span> =  <span class="org-string">'%R.synctex.gz'</span>;
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
If you always use the same engine to compile, then you can add a line like this to your latexmkrc:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-shell">$ <span class="org-variable-name">pdf_mode</span> = n
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
where n=1 for pdflatex, 4 for lualatex, and 5 for xelatex. The compile command then becomes simply
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-shell">latexmk sample.tex
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Since I use Emacs, I could just add latexmk to the list of TeX commands and compile documents with a simple keystroke. The problem is that I don’t do the smart thing and use just one engine. I like to use pdflatex sometimes and lualatex for other documents. It would be nice if I could specify the compiling steps within the document.

 <p>
Here’s where Arara shines. Arara is another way to compile tex files. Unlike latexmk, arara does not do anything automatically. Running

doesn’t do anything without some special instructions within the file. To compile the file with pdflatex, I would put this as the first line:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-nil">% arara: pdflatex: { interaction: nonstopmode, synctex: yes }
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Then, running arara on the file would compile once with pdflatex. If I had a bibliography and wanted to use lualatex, I would put this at the top of the file:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-nil">% arara: lualatex: { interaction: nonstopmode, synctex: yes }
% arara: biber
% arara: lualatex: { interaction: nonstopmode, synctex: yes }
% arara: lualatex: { interaction: nonstopmode, synctex: yes }
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
This would get all of the steps that I described above. So, I could compile any file with the same command, and have it compile exactly the way I wanted with the engine that I specified.
</p>

 <p>
The problem (and I admit it’s a minor one) is that I lose the automation of latexmk. Latexmk does all of the steps automatically, and only  <i>if</i> they are needed. Arara does them all every time. Latexmk is smart, but not easily flexible. Arara is very flexible, but not very smart.
</p>
</div>
</section> <section id="outline-container-org08b2ad7" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="org08b2ad7">Solution</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org08b2ad7">
 <p>
Fortunately, arara can be told to compile with latexmk, and the engine and any options can be specified in the file. This compiles with latexmk using pdflatex:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-nil">% arara: latexmk: { engine: pdflatex }
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Since the options that I want are in my latexmkrc file, there’s nothing else I need to do. Changing “pdflatex” to “lualatex” would make it compile with lualatex instead as many times as necessary to produce the final document.

  <title>Styling Arguments in Org Mode</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jan 23, 2023 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Styling Arguments in Org Mode</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 23, 2023 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
Org mode is particularly useful for its ability to easily export to many other file formats. I often prepare handouts that contain philosophical arguments. Some of these handouts are intended to be printed, others are intended to be viewed electronically. Printed handouts are prepared by exporting the org file to PDF using LaTeX, and the other handouts are made by exporting to HTML.
</p>

 <p>
We often put arguments in what is called “standard form.” The premises are written on numbered lines, with a line underneath the last premise. The conclusion is then written beneath the line. In LaTeX, this is easily done with this code:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-LaTeX"> <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\begin</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">enumerate</span>}
 <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\item</span></span> First Premise
 <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\item</span></span>  <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\underline</span></span>{ <span class="org-font-latex-underline">Last Premise</span>}
 <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\item</span></span> [ <span class="org-variable-name"> <span class="org-font-latex-math">$</span></span> <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-variable-name"> <span class="org-font-latex-math">\therefore</span></span></span> <span class="org-variable-name"> <span class="org-font-latex-math">$</span></span>] Conclusion
 <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\end</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">enumerate</span>}
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
For HTML, I use a class  that I named “arg” and defined in my custom css file:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-css"> <span class="org-css-selector">.arg li:last-child</span> {
   <span class="org-css-property">list-style</span>: none;
}

 <span class="org-css-selector">.arg li:nth-last-child(2)</span> {
   <span class="org-css-property">text-decoration</span>: underline;
}

 <span class="org-css-selector">.arg li</span> {
   <span class="org-css-property">margin</span>: 0px;
}
</pre>
</div>


 <p>
This tells the rendering engine to not put any number before the last item of a list (nor any other styling) and to underline the penultimate item of the list. 
</p>

 <p>
To use an HTML class in org mode, just put this immediately before the element you want to style:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-org"> <span class="org-org-meta-line">#+ATTR_HTML: :class classname</span>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
The argument is written like this:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-nil">#+ATTR_HTML: :class arg
1. First premise
2. Second premise
3. Conclusion
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
which produces this:
</p>

 <ol class="org-ol arg"> <li>First premise</li>
 <li>Second premise</li>
 <li>Conclusion</li>
</ol> <div class="tagline" id="org4edcbde">

  <title>Updating the Site</title>

I’ve had trouble getting verified as an educator with GitLab. After getting some notification from them that the “ultimate” status was being downgraded on my site project (not that it really would have mattered for this, since it’s a public repository), I decided to move it to GitHub, where I’ve had it before. I had moved it to GitLab because GitLab would do the Hugo build for me after I pushed the updated content to them. In the past, GitHub would build a Jekyll site, but any others needed to be built locally. So, I was pleasantly surprised to see that I could set up a Hugo build on GitHub now. Unfortunately, I couldn’t get it to work reliably. What did work exceptionally well is to connect the repository to  <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a>, and let them handle serving the site. I followed the  <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/">instructions</a> in the Hugo documentation, and everything went very smoothly. Netlify automatically detected that the repository was a Hugo site. Their instructions for pointing the domain’s name servers to Netlify were clear and simple to follow. It’s important to note that the site’s theme  <i>must</i> be installed as a git submodule. It won’t work as a simple git clone. The instructions for most Hugo themes that I see specify installing as a submodule, so you likely already have that done.
</p>

 <p>
This seemed to be a good opportunity to update the site’s theme. I had started with another theme and rewrote it into my own, but lately I’ve been happier letting other people do as much of the configuration work as possible, which explains my move back to  <a href="https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs">Doom Emacs</a>. I picked the  <a href="https://github.com/WingLim/hugo-tania">Hugo Tania</a> theme, since it has nice built-in search and tag support.
</p>
 <section id="outline-container-org89933c5" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="org89933c5">Hugo and Org Mode</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org89933c5">
 <p>
I do most of my writing in Org mode in Emacs. Markdown is the most commonly used simple markup language, and Hugo has always had excellent native support for it. I remember its native support for Org mode to be missing some important things, although I can’t really remember what they were. So, I was using  <a href="https://ox-hugo.scripter.co">ox-hugo</a> to convert the Org files to Markdown. Evidently, Hugo’s parser for Org mode is much more robust than it was, because I haven’t had a problem with it parsing native Org files. So, I removed the ox-hugo package and now my posts are written in Org mode and not converted to Markdown. To do so, simply put the Hugo front-matter at the beginning in typical Org fashion. For instance, the front-matter for this post looks like this:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-org"> <span class="org-org-document-info-keyword">#+TITLE:</span>  <span class="org-org-document-title">Updating the Site</span>
 <span class="org-org-meta-line">#+draft: false</span>
 <span class="org-org-meta-line">#+tags[]: hugo emacs org</span>
 <span class="org-org-document-info-keyword">#+date:</span>  <span class="org-org-document-info">2023-01-24T06:41:27</span>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Now, that’s all that really needs to be done. You can just write posts in Org mode, commit the changes, and push to the repository. Netlify detects that the repository has been changed and rebuilds the site. Of course, since this is Emacs, all of this except the writing can be automated. I modified the scripts that I was using for ox-hugo to make the process simple.
</p>

 <p>
First, there is a function that updates the date for the post:
</p>


 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-elisp">( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">hugo-timestamp</span> ()
   <span class="org-doc">"Update existing date: timestamp on a Hugo post."</span>
  ( <span class="org-keyword">interactive</span>)
  ( <span class="org-keyword">save-excursion</span> (
                   goto-char 1)
                  (re-search-forward  <span class="org-string">"^#\\+date:"</span>)
                  ( <span class="org-keyword">let</span> ((beg (point)))
                    (end-of-line)
                    (delete-region beg (point)))
                  (insert (concat  <span class="org-string">" "</span> (format-time-string  <span class="org-string">"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S"</span>)))))
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
This sets some variables that are used later. The hugo-post-template variable contains the front-matter items that I generally use. 
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-elisp">( <span class="org-keyword">defvar</span>  <span class="org-variable-name">hugo-directory</span>  <span class="org-string">"~/Sites/blog/"</span>  <span class="org-doc">"Path to Hugo blog."</span>)
( <span class="org-keyword">defvar</span>  <span class="org-variable-name">hugo-posts-dir</span>  <span class="org-string">"content/posts/"</span>  <span class="org-doc">"Relative path to posts directory."</span>)
( <span class="org-keyword">defvar</span>  <span class="org-variable-name">hugo-post-ext</span>  <span class="org-string">".org"</span>   <span class="org-doc">"File extension of Hugo posts."</span>)
( <span class="org-keyword">defvar</span>  <span class="org-variable-name">hugo-post-template</span>  <span class="org-string">"#+TITLE: </span> <span class="org-string"> <span class="org-warning">\</span></span> <span class="org-string">%s\n#+draft: true\n#+tags[]: \n#+date: \n#+mathjax: \n\n"</span>
   <span class="org-doc">"Default template for Hugo posts. %s will be replace by the post title."</span>)
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
These are used to generate the file name:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-elisp">( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">hugo-make-slug</span> (s)  <span class="org-doc">"Turn a string into a slug."</span>
       (replace-regexp-in-string  <span class="org-string">" "</span>  <span class="org-string">"-"</span>  (downcase (replace-regexp-in-string  <span class="org-string">"[</span> <span class="org-string"> <span class="org-negation-char">^</span></span> <span class="org-string">A-Za-z0-9 ]"</span>  <span class="org-string">""</span> s))))

( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">hugo-yaml-escape</span> (s)  <span class="org-doc">"Escape a string for YAML."</span>
       ( <span class="org-keyword">if</span> ( <span class="org-keyword">or</span> (string-match  <span class="org-string">":"</span> s) (string-match  <span class="org-string">"\""</span> s)) (concat  <span class="org-string">"\""</span> (replace-regexp-in-string  <span class="org-string">"\""</span>  <span class="org-string">"\\\\\""</span> s)  <span class="org-string">"\""</span>) s))
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
This creates the file and puts in the front-matter:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-elisp">( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">hugo-draft-post</span> (title)  <span class="org-doc">"Create a new Hugo blog post."</span>
       ( <span class="org-keyword">interactive</span>  <span class="org-string">"sPost Title: "</span>)
       ( <span class="org-keyword">let</span> ((draft-file (concat hugo-directory hugo-posts-dir
                                 (format-time-string  <span class="org-string">"%Y-%m-%d-"</span>)
                                 (hugo-make-slug title)
                                 hugo-post-ext)))
         ( <span class="org-keyword">if</span> (file-exists-p draft-file)
             (find-file draft-file)
           (find-file draft-file)
           (insert (format hugo-post-template (hugo-yaml-escape title)))
           (hugo-timestamp))))
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
This sets “draft” to “true”, updates the date stamp, and saves the file:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-elisp">( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">hugo-publish-post</span> ()
   <span class="org-doc">"Set draft to false and save."</span>
  ( <span class="org-keyword">interactive</span>)
  ( <span class="org-keyword">save-excursion</span> (
                   goto-char 1)
                  (re-search-forward  <span class="org-string">"^#\\+draft:"</span>)
                  ( <span class="org-keyword">let</span> ((beg (point)))
                    (end-of-line)
                    (delete-region beg (point)))
                  (insert  <span class="org-string">" false"</span>)
                  (hugo-timestamp))
  (save-buffer))
</pre>
</div>


 <p>
This commits the changes and pushes them to GitHub, using the current date and time as the commit message:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-elisp">( <span class="org-keyword">defmacro</span>  <span class="org-function-name">with-dir</span> (DIR  <span class="org-type">&rest</span> FORMS)
   <span class="org-doc">"Execute FORMS in DIR."</span>
  ( <span class="org-keyword">let</span> ((orig-dir (gensym)))
    `( <span class="org-keyword">progn</span> ( <span class="org-keyword">setq</span> ,orig-dir default-directory)
            (cd ,DIR) ,@FORMS (cd ,orig-dir))))

( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">hugo-deploy</span> ()
   <span class="org-doc">"Push changes upstream."</span>
  ( <span class="org-keyword">interactive</span>)
  (with-dir hugo-directory
            (shell-command  <span class="org-string">"git add ."</span>)
            ( <span class="org-keyword">--></span> (current-time-string)
                 (concat  <span class="org-string">"git commit -m \""</span> it  <span class="org-string">"\""</span>)
                 (shell-command it))
            (magit-push-current-to-upstream nil)))
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Finally, set some keybindings to make it all easy.
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-elisp">(global-set-key (kbd  <span class="org-string">"C-c h n"</span>) 'hugo-draft-post)
(global-set-key (kbd  <span class="org-string">"C-c h p"</span>) 'hugo-publish-post)
(global-set-key (kbd  <span class="org-string">"C-c h t"</span>) 'hugo-timestamp)
(global-set-key (kbd  <span class="org-string">"C-c h O"</span>) ( <span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> () ( <span class="org-keyword">interactive</span>) (find-file  <span class="org-string">"~/Sites/blog/"</span>)))
(global-set-key (kbd  <span class="org-string">"C-c h P"</span>) ( <span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> () ( <span class="org-keyword">interactive</span>) (find-file  <span class="org-string">"~/Sites/blog/content/post/"</span>)))
(global-set-key (kbd  <span class="org-string">"C-c h d"</span>) 'hugo-deploy)
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
I have a few more things to do, like create “About” and tag pages, and adjust the footnote styling. Unfortunately, I need to get ready for the new semester which begins on Thursday.

  <title>Org Mode Footnotes in Hugo</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Org Mode Footnotes in Hugo</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Jan 25, 2023 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
I mentioned yesterday that I couldn’t remember what I didn’t like about Hugo’s parsing of Org mode in the past. When I viewed the published post, I quickly remembered what it was: footnotes. If I remember correctly, at the time that I first tried using native Org mode parsing, Hugo didn’t parse the footnotes at all. Now, it does, but they render in an odd way. The footnote number is in subscript on one line, followed by a blank line, followed by the footnote text on another line. So, instead of getting something like this:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-nil">1. Footnote text.
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
We get this:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-nil">1.

Footnote text.
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
A Google search resulted in one question on the  <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/footnotes-rendered-different-for-org-files-compared-to-markdown-source/20415/">Hugo help forum</a>, but no good answer. The problem is the way that Hugo renders the HTML. In a Markdown post, this content
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-markdown">This is a footnote test. <span class="org-markdown-markup">[^</span> <span class="org-markdown-footnote-marker">1</span> <span class="org-markdown-markup">]</span>

 <span class="org-markdown-markup">[^</span> <span class="org-markdown-footnote-marker">1</span> <span class="org-markdown-markup">]:</span>  <span class="org-markdown-url">Footnote content.</span>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
results in this HTML code:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-html">< <span class="org-function-name">div</span>  <span class="org-variable-name">class</span>= <span class="org-string">"article-post"</span>>

    </ <span class="org-function-name">div</span>>

</ <span class="org-function-name">div</span>>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
This turns the footnotes into numbered list items that end with a nice return character that is linked to the footnote number in the text.
</p>

This Org mode content, however,

    </ <span class="org-function-name">div</span>>

</ <span class="org-function-name">div</span>>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Notice that there is no list, instead the footnote text is separated from the number by a  <code><div></code>, which is normally rendered as an empty line.
</p>

 <p>
Hacking around with some CSS, I managed to get the number and the text on the same line. <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> Here’s the CSS code:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-css"> <span class="org-css-selector">.footnote-definition</span> {
   <span class="org-css-property">display</span>: block;
}

 <span class="org-css-selector">.footnote-body</span> {
   <span class="org-css-property">display</span>: inline-block;
}
</pre>
</div>



 <p>
I’m not quite satisfied with the superscript number in the footnote, but I haven’t found a good fix for that yet.
</p>



 <div class="tagline" id="org4ddf30a">

  <title>List Spacing in Org Mode with Enumitem</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Feb 01, 2023 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">List Spacing in Org Mode with Enumitem</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Feb 01, 2023 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
I like to use the LaTeX package enumitem to eliminate the spacing in lists. To do this globally, add the following to the Org mode headers:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-org"> <span class="org-org-meta-line">#+LaTeX_HEADER: \usepackage{enumitem}</span>
 <span class="org-org-meta-line">#+LaTeX_HEADER: \setlist{nosep}</span>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
If you also don’t want your lists to be indented, use 
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-org"> <span class="org-org-meta-line">#+LaTeX_HEADER: \setlist{nosep,wide}</span>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
These global options can be overridden for individual lists by putting something like this immediately before the list begins:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-org"> <span class="org-org-meta-line">#+ATTR_LaTeX: :options [itemsep=1em]</span>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
This will put a space equal to the width of an upper-case “M” between each list item. 
</p>

  <title>Venn Diagrams in LaTeX</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Feb 04, 2023 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Venn Diagrams in LaTeX</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Feb 04, 2023 00:00</p>
</header> <p>
I wrote a 2017 post describing how I code Venn diagrams in LaTeX with TikZ. Venn diagrams in categorical logic tend to be different from their standard uses in mathematics. There are a few LaTeX packages for Venn diagrams, but, for some reason, I didn’t think they could be used to produce the diagrams I needed for my critical thinking course. I should have looked at them a bit more carefully, it turns out that making the diagrams using the  <code>venndiagram</code>  <a href="https://mirror.math.princeton.edu/pub/CTAN/macros/LaTeX/contrib/venndiagram/venndiagram.pdf">package</a> is much easier than my method.
</p>

 <p>
 <code>Venndiagram</code>, like my method, uses TikZ to make the diagram. The advantage, though, is that we don’t have to dig into the details of TikZ for everything, that is already done for us. For example, here is the code for the diagram for an A-sentence using my previous method.
</p>


 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-LaTeX"> <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\begin</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">tikzpicture</span>}[thick,scale=1, every node/.style={transform shape}]
   <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\begin</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">scope</span>}
     <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\begin</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">scope</span>}[even odd rule]
       <span class="org-font-latex-sedate">\clip</span>  <span class="org-font-latex-sedate">\pred</span> (-1.5,-1.5) rectangle (1.5,1.5);
       <span class="org-font-latex-sedate">\fill</span>[gray]  <span class="org-font-latex-sedate">\sub</span>;
     <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\end</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">scope</span>}
     <span class="org-font-latex-sedate">\draw</span> (-2,-0) node { <span class="org-font-latex-math">$A$</span>};
     <span class="org-font-latex-sedate">\draw</span> (4,0) node { <span class="org-font-latex-math">$B$</span>};
     <span class="org-font-latex-sedate">\draw</span>  <span class="org-font-latex-sedate">\sub</span>;
     <span class="org-font-latex-sedate">\draw</span>  <span class="org-font-latex-sedate">\pred</span>;
   <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\end</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">scope</span>}
 <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\end</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">tikzpicture</span>}
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Here is the code for the  same diagram with the  <code>venndiagram</code> package.
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-LaTeX"> <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\begin</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">venndiagram2sets</span>}
  [tikzoptions={scale=1,thick}, showframe=false]
   <span class="org-font-latex-sedate">\fillANotB</span>
 <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\end</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">venndiagram2sets</span>}
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
It produces this:
</p>


 <figure id="org5f663dd"> <img src="../images/posts/a-sentence.png" alt="a-sentence.png" width="400"></img> <figcaption> <span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>Venn diagram of an A-sentence in categorical logic.</figcaption></figure> <p>
Here’s the code for Disamis (IAI-3):
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-LaTeX"> <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\begin</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">venndiagram3sets</span>}
  [
  tikzoptions={scale=1,thick},
  showframe=false,
  labelOnlyB={x},
  labelABC={x}
  ]
   <span class="org-font-latex-sedate">\fillCNotA</span>
 <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\end</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">venndiagram3sets</span>}
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
The resulting diagram looks like this:
</p>


 <figure id="org8adba6e"> <img src="../images/posts/disamis.png" alt="disamis.png" width="400px"></img> <figcaption> <span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>Venn diagram of Disamis in categorical logic.</figcaption></figure> <p>
There was no way that I could remember my all of the details of my original method, so I had an 84-line snippet that I inserted for each diagram. I would then comment and uncomment various lines to produce the diagram I needed.
</p>

 <p>
Now, I just use this snippet for a 2-circle diagram:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-LaTeX"> <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\begin</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">venndiagram2sets</span>}
  [
  tikzoptions={scale=1,thick},
  showframe=false,
  labelA=S,
  labelB=P,
  labelOnlyA={x},
  labelAB={x}
  ]
   <span class="org-font-latex-sedate">\fillANotB</span>
 <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\end</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">venndiagram2sets</span>}
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
I use this for a 3-circle diagram:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-LaTeX"> <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\begin</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">venndiagram3sets</span>}
  [
  tikzoptions={scale=1,thick},
  showframe=false,
  labelA=S,  <span class="org-comment">%label circle A with "S"</span>
  labelB=P,  <span class="org-comment">%label circle B with "P"</span>
  labelC=M,  <span class="org-comment">%label circle M with "M"</span>
  labelOnlyA={x},  <span class="org-comment">%puts an "x" in the region belonging only to A</span>
  labelOnlyBC={x},  <span class="org-comment">%puts an "x" in intersection of B and C.</span>
  labelABC={x}  <span class="org-comment">%puts an "x" in the the intersection of A, B, and C.</span>
  ]
   <span class="org-font-latex-sedate">\fillANotB</span>  <span class="org-comment">%fills the region belonging only to B</span>
   <span class="org-font-latex-sedate">\fillBCapC</span>  <span class="org-comment">%fills the intersection of B and C.</span>
   <span class="org-comment">% To put an x on the lines, uncomment the following:</span>
   <span class="org-comment">% </span> <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-comment">\setpostvennhook</span></span> <span class="org-comment"> % places an "x" in other locations of the diagram.</span>
   <span class="org-comment">% {</span>
   <span class="org-comment">% </span> <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-comment">\node</span></span> <span class="org-comment">[above = 1.6cm of labelC] {X};</span>
   <span class="org-comment">% </span> <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-comment">\node</span></span> <span class="org-comment">[above left = 1.4cm and .25cm of labelC, rotate=45] {X};</span>
   <span class="org-comment">% }</span>
 <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\end</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">venndiagram3sets</span>}
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Both have enough detail that I can remember what to change to make a particular diagram. I’ve added some extra comments to explain what everything does. I Include the  <code>scale=1</code> only so that I can remember what to do when I want to change the size of the diagram. The only tricky part is when I have to place an x on the border of a particular circle, that requires a little bit of TikZ fiddling, hence the commented lines at the end of the snippet.

I found some some new functions for automating Hugo in Emacs, that I was able to modify slightly to fit my own needs.
</p>

 <p>
 <a href="https://whatacold.io/blog/2022-10-10-emacs-hugo-blogging/">Ken Huang</a> has a nice function to select a tag from a list of tags used on the site, then insert it into the right place in the front-matter.

 <p>
Look at this post from  <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/productivity/create-websites-with-org-mode-and-hugo/">Peter Prevos</a>, for inserting links to other pages in the site. With it, you’re able to just   <code>C-c C-l</code> to bring up a list of link types, select “hugo”, then pick the file name of the page you want to link. This is the code:
</p>


 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"> <span class="org-comment-delimiter">;; </span> <span class="org-comment">Follow Hugo links</span>
  ( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">org-hugo-follow</span> (link)
     <span class="org-doc">"Follow Hugo link shortcodes"</span>

     (string-trim  <span class="org-string">"{{</* ref test.org */>}}"</span>  <span class="org-string">"{{</* ref "</span>  <span class="org-string">"*/>}}"</span>)))

   <span class="org-comment-delimiter">;; </span> <span class="org-comment">New link type for Org-Hugo internal links</span>
  (org-link-set-parameters
    <span class="org-string">"hugo"</span>
    <span class="org-builtin">:complete</span> ( <span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> ()
               (concat  <span class="org-string">"{{</* ref "</span>
                       (file-name-nondirectory
                        (read-file-name  <span class="org-string">"File: "</span>))

    <span class="org-builtin">:follow</span> #'org-hugo-follow)
</pre>
</div>



 <p>
They both have some other useful things that might also be helpful. I’m grateful to others who solve problems they have and post the code online. I know just enough Emacs-lisp to figure out what is going on, and modify something to my own particular use-case, but not enough to be able to start from scratch.

For those of us who live in Emacs, it’s always a bad feeling when Emacs won’t start, which happened to me today after upgrading my office Mac. I ran  <code>doom doctor</code> which ran through a few checks and stopped with

I had this problem on another machine a few weeks ago, researched it, fixed it, and apparently I’ve already forgotten what to do. When  <code>doom upgrade</code> fails, it’s likely to be because someone changed the name of a branch in the repository. The easiest thing to do is to delete  <code>~/.emacs.d/.local/straight/repos</code>. Run  <code>doom sync</code> to rebuild the repositories, and everything should work fine.

 <blockquote>

  <title>Introduction to Existentialism</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <header> <h1 class="title">Introduction to Existentialism</h1>
 <p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Apr 13, 2023 00:00</p>
</header> <section id="outline-container-org2bae9c8" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="org2bae9c8">Introduction</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2bae9c8">
 <p>
This seems to be our condition:
</p>

 <p>
We find ourselves in a malaise, living lives that are out of our control, superficially connected, but ever so disconnected in the ways that matter. Some go on in blissful ignorance, but those who are more self-reflective, ask, “What, if anything, is the meaning of life?” In response, they hear either the incoherent noise of the mob, or the deafening silence of the abyss.
</p>

 <p>
Existentialism is a branch of philosophy that attempts, if not to provide answers, at least to diagnose the problem.
</p>
</div>
 <div id="outline-container-org3479e1b" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="org3479e1b">Who are the Existentialists?</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3479e1b">
 <p>
Saying who counts as an existentialist is more difficult than one might think for two reasons:
</p>

 <p>
First, almost all of the thinkers who we associate with existentialism expressly rejected the label at some point. As far as I know, only Karl Jaspers gladly claimed to be an existentialist.
</p>

 <p>
Second, who is counted as an existentialist depends on how one defines existentialism, and there’s no consensus on a simple definition. I tend to think of existentialism in terms of some themes that tend to go together. It’s a broad understanding, so my list of existentialists is pretty long. I’m willing to include:
</p>

 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>The author of Job</li>
 <li>The author of Ecclesiastes</li>
 <li>Greek Cynics</li>
 <li>Augustine</li>
 <li>Pascal</li>
</ul> <p>
Four names are particularly important. Two from the 19th century are Kierkegaard, a Danish philosopher and theologian, and Nietzsche, a German philosopher. From them, we get the two branches of existentialism, a religious branch and an atheistic branch.
</p>

 <p>
The other two names are from the 20th century. First is Martin Heidegger, a German philosopher; second is Jean-Paul Sartre, a French philosopher. All of the proposed lists of existentialists differ somewhat, but everyone agrees that those two belong on the list.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</section> <section id="outline-container-orgaa77858" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="orgaa77858">What is Existentialism?</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgaa77858">
 <p>
Existentialism is about existence, but existence used in a particular way. It’s the kind of existence that is had only by human beings, and distinguishes humans from other creatures. What this is will, I hope, become clear as we look at some common existentialist themes.
</p>
</div>
 <div id="outline-container-org9f8848a" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="org9f8848a">Alienation</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9f8848a">
 <p>
The first theme is alienation — alienation from the world, alienation from others, and alienation from oneself. Like the ancient stoics, Heidegger and Sartre thought that this alienation was a result of false beliefs about the world and about human beings. Existentialist philosophy, then, was therapy, a treatment for existential alienation.
</p>
</div>
</div>
 <div id="outline-container-org104b2f9" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="org104b2f9">Being-in-the-World</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org104b2f9">
 <p>
One of the causes of this alienation is our failure to understand the nature of human existence and our relation to the world. What is the world? The standard way to answer this question is to list the things that the world contains. As I look around, I see a few things that I might want to put on my list: books, clocks, and classrooms. The problem with these lists, according to the existentialists, is not the lists themselves, it is the pretension to objectivity. 
</p>

 <p>
To call something a book, clock, or classroom is to have already taken a stand on what that that thing is  <i>for</i>. These are examples of what Heidegger calls things “ready-to-hand”.
To encounter something as ready-to-hand is to see it as useful for some purpose. They have what Sartre calls ’being-in-itself,’ that is, there is something that they are. When I tell you that something is a water-bottle, you know what it is for. I’ve described its essence, in a sense. That presupposes my previous encounter with water-bottles, though, hence the famous existentialist dictum, “Existence precedes essence.”
</p>

 <p>
We are beings in the world, but the nature of our being is not like those things that are present or ready at hand. Instead, Heidegger calls the being of humans by a technical term,  <i>Dasein</i>, Sartre’s phrase is ’being-for-itself.’ How does the being that we have differ from the being of the things present-at-hand?
</p>

 <p>
We are the only creatures that take a stand on what it means to be human. My dog, as far as I know, never considers what it really means to be a dog. There is no list of goals in her puppy school yearbook that says “Becoming more fully dog.” We though, have Bible studies on being a man or woman, bookstores sell self-help books on capturing our masculine and feminine identities, and we hear people say things like “I’m trying to discover myself,” or “I want to pick the major that is right for me,” or “I’m trying to find the person who is perfect for me.” That is one of the sources of our alienation. We want to know what we are right now, but we can’t have it, for it assumes that we are being-in-itself, but instead we are being-for-itself.
</p>

 <p>
Let me explain. First, contrary to another well-used phrase, we don’t simply “live in the moment.” What we are as individuals, is not something that is static in time. In fact, I can’t even, in a sense, think of myself as solely in this moment, because I can’t separate my current self from my future self. When you ask, “Is this the right person for me?” you are really asking, “Is this the right person for me, given my plans for the future, and who I want to become.” We are, whether we want to or not, always in the process of becoming. Sartre uses the language of facticity and transcendence to refer to the static, and to the becoming.
</p>

 <p>
Second, to say that there is something that I am, is often used as an excuse. “I couldn’t help it, that’s just what I am.” Sartre was drafted into the French army, was captured by the Germans in 1940, and then spent nine months in a German prisoner of war camp. What he has in mind here is the person who says, I can’t go to war, because I am a coward. That’s just what I am.
</p>

 <div id="outline-container-org7d01e73" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="org7d01e73">Rejection of dualisms</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7d01e73">
 <p>
Another characteristic theme of existentialism is the rejection, or dissolution, of dualisms. Here are some examples:
</p>

 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>The subjective vs. the objective</li>
 <li>Mind vs. body</li>
 <li>Reason vs. emotions or passions</li>
 <li>Fact vs. value: the things we encounter are ready-to-hand, already imbued with value.</li>
</ul></div>
</div>
 <div id="outline-container-org7c28a0a" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="org7c28a0a">The self and others</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7c28a0a">
 <p>
We fall into the trap of defining ourselves in terms of others, feeling like we must live up to their expectations, or succumb to their demands, or merely do something because “that’s what one does.”
</p>

 <p>
Sartre’s masterpiece play,  <i>No Exit</i> is the perfect illustration. Three people find themselves locked in a room together in Hell. There are no torture devices. I love the scene when one woman, particularly vain, despairs at the lack of a mirror. Another woman, offers to be her mirror and describe to her what she sees. She says, “Hello, what’s that — that nasty red spot at the bottom of your cheek? A pimple?” The conclusion is that “Hell is other people.”
</p>

 <p>
Incidentally, this refusal to follow the herd is what Nietzsche admired in Jesus. (People are always surprised when I tell them how much Nietzsche admired Jesus, given his attitude towards Christianity. He said, “The only true Christian died on a cross.”)
</p>
</div>
</div>
 <div id="outline-container-orgd9b1cb3" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="orgd9b1cb3">Freedom, anxiety, death, and the absurd</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd9b1cb3">
 <p>
These are very interconnected, so I’ll treat them as one theme.
</p>

 <p>
Anxiety is a pivotal concept in existentialist thought. Kierkegaard wrote a whole book titled  <i>The Concept of Anxiety.</i> It’s not what we usually understand as anxiety, though. Maybe it’s better to use the German word,  <i>angst</i>, not because of its meaning in German, but because we English speakers can better treat it as a technical term, or term of art, because that is certainly what it is in existentialism. Angst is the disturbing feeling that we have when confronted with our possibilities. Sartre’s preferred example is vertigo, that disturbing feeling one has standing at the edge of a cliff. Sartre points out that it can’t be the fear of falling, you’re not going to fall. So what is it? It must be the knowledge that you could throw yourself over. We always face a choice, and nothing prevents us from taking the choice. We are free, and that is the source of our anxiety, or as Kierkegaard puts it, despair.
</p>

 <p>
This freedom is not the same thing as political freedom. Even people who lack political freedom still have this existential freedom. It’s also not what philosophers call metaphysical freedom. It’s not about determinism or fatalism. Even if we are determined, we must still choose.
</p>

 <p>
We often pretend that we don’t have a choice, though. I don’t want to go to class, but I have to. (That’s something that I hear from both students and colleagues.) That’s a fiction that we construct, though, an example of what Sartre calls, bad-faith, a kind of self-deception. The man who refuses to join the resistance because he is a coward is living in another kind of bad-faith. There is always a choice.
</p>

 <p>
Angst is a result of our freedom, but only because we face death. Given our mortality, our choices have a weight, or importance, that they otherwise would not have. It’s only because we face death that our choices have the importance that they do. Otherwise, we could do everything, and it wouldn’t matter what we chose now. There would always be another opportunity. Also, it is only because we are mortal that we are individuals. Sartre’s response to the man who claims to be a coward is “No, you do not do these things because you are a coward, you are a coward because you do these things.” We are defined by our choices. If there were an infinite time in which to make choices, we would conceivably make every possible choice, and therefore there would be no choice that individuated us.
</p>

 <p>
Finally, there is the absurd. Sartre claims that death is absurd, in that we rarely get to finish our projects. We are absurd, in that we want to pretend to live in facticity, but cannot deny our transcendence. The world is absurd, because it refuses to be what we want it to be. I must choose, and to choose, I must value some things over another, but there is no reason why I should value what I do. In fact, my values, are a result of my choices — absurd.
</p>
</div>
</div>
 <div id="outline-container-org5977f0b" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="org5977f0b">Authenticity</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5977f0b">
 <p>
Because we have a tendency to conform to the leveled-down roles and identities of the public world, the question of authenticity, of being true to oneself, is central to the existentialists. The idea is formulated in many different ways, in terms of being a ’knight of faith’ (Kierkegaard), for example, an ’overman’ (Nietzsche), a ’rebel’ (Camus), or an ’authentic individual’ (Heidegger). In this way, existentialists develop the possibility of living a meaningful, committed, and fulfilling life in the face of absurdity and death. The idea of authenticity serves as a powerful rejoinder to the criticism of existentialism as representing a kind of nihilistic, ’anything goes’ philosophy.
</p>
</div>
</div>
 <div id="outline-container-orgf44194c" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="orgf44194c">Responsibility</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf44194c">
 <p>
We are free and responsible for who we are and what we do. No moral absolutes, utilitarian calculations, or natural laws that can explain, justify, or rationalize our actions. As Sartre writes, when it comes to human actions, “there are no excuses behind us nor justifications before us.”
</p>

 <p>
Existentialism does not, in itself, require adherence to any normative moral principle. Yet the argument that existentialism is an amoral philosophy is undeserved. Existentialism centers around the most fundamental of moral questions: ‘ What should I do?’ and ’How should I live?’ Moreover, in acknowledging our fundamental freedom, existentialists recognize that we are not free from taking responsibility for our actions or from cultivating the ideal of freedom for others. To this end, existentialism offers a clear vision of what a valuable or praiseworthy way of life is. It is a life that faces up to the inescapable freedom and vulnerability of the human situation, and takes responsibility for the fact that our actions have consequences and impact the lives of others.

  <title>Emacs Literate Config</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <h1 class="title">Emacs Literate Config
 <br></br> <span class="subtitle">Aug 02, 2023 00:00</span>
</h1>
 <p>
Having some time this summer, I decided to try to convert my very disorganized Emacs config files into one Org-mode file. I have had a literate config in the past, and it went much more easily than I remember. If you’re thinking about creating one, here is what I recommend.
</p>

 <p>
First, use the same org file to generate both  <code>early-init.el</code> and  <code>init.el</code>. The file that a section tangles to is specified in the section’s properties. My first top-level section heading is this:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-org"> <span class="org-org-level-1">* Early init file</span>
 <span class="org-org-drawer">:PROPERTIES:</span>
 <span class="org-org-special-keyword">:header-args:</span>  <span class="org-org-property-value">:tangle early-init.el</span>
 <span class="org-org-drawer">:END:</span>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Anything in this section becomes part of  <code>early-init.el</code>. All of the other top-level sections specify to tangle to  <code>init.el</code>. Both files are created when the Org file is tangled. Lower-level sections inherit their properties from the top-levels. So, only the top-level sections need the properties specified.
</p>

 <p>
I recommend beginning by adding just enough to set up package management and installing  <a href="https://github.com/yilkalargaw/org-auto-tangle">Org Auto Tangle</a>, and then use  <code>C-c C-v t</code> to tangle the file and generate both  <code>early-init.el</code> and  <code>init.el</code>. After that, Org Auto Tangle will automatically tangle the file every time that the Org file is saved.
</p>

 <p>
My  <a href="https://github.com/rlridenour/config-files/blob/master/emacs/README.org">Emacs Config</a> is on Github. View the raw file to see all of the properties and src blocks.

  <title>Fixing a HomePod Stuck in Configuration</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <h1 class="title">Fixing a HomePod Stuck in Configuration
 <br></br> <span class="subtitle">Dec 26, 2023 00:00</span>
</h1>
 <p>
I’ve had a HomePod Mini in my home office for about six months now that has been working great. I’m really impressed with the audio produced by such a small speaker. I’ve been wanting another one to try out a stereo pair, so I put it on my Christmas list. Installing the first one was simple, but installing the second was frustrating. I connected it to power, and scanned the light with my iPhone. The HomePod went through a set-up process, offered to pair to the first, but the stereo pairing never worked. I noticed that the Home app said that the new HomePod was being configured and full functionality would be available shortly, but it never finished. I also notice that the old HomePod was on version 17.2 of the HomePod software, but the new one was still on version 16.0. So, as one does in such cases, I turned to the Internet for solutions. Evidently, this is a common problem, especially with HomePods on version 16.0 of the software. and here are some of the potential solutions that I found.
</p>

 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>Unplug for at least ten seconds, then reconnect to power. The HomePod should update. (It didn’t).</li>
 <li>Change your location setting in iCloud to something else, update the HomePod, and then change the location to the original setting. (I found that you can’t change your location setting until you first cancel Apple One and other subscriptions, which I did not want to until I was absolutely desperate.)</li>
 <li>Install the HomePod into a temporary new home in the Home app.</li>
 <li>Connect the new HomePod to a Mac and update in the Finder.</li>
</ul> <p>
A combination of the last two worked. Here are the steps that I remember doing, if you ever find yourself in the same position:
</p>

 <ol class="org-ol"> <li>Connect the HomePod to a Mac. Select it when it shows up in the Finder sidebar, and choose to restore it. It will then update to the latest version of the software.</li>
 <li>Remove the old HomePod from the Home app by selecting it in the Home app, selecting “Reset HomePod…”, and then selecting “Remove Accessory”. (I don’t know if this was necessary, but it’s what I did.)</li>
 <li>Add a new home in the Home app by first clicking on the circle with three little dots inside in the top right corner. In the “Home Settings” page, you’ll find “Add Home” in the top left. Name it anything you like.</li>
 <li>Add the new HomePod to the new home. After the installation process is finally complete, move the new HomePod to the old home, by selecting the HomePod and choosing “Remove Accessory”.</li>
 <li>Add the new HomePod to the original home. Then, I added the old Homepod as a stereo pair. After everything was working, I then deleted the new temporary home from the Home app.</li>
</ol> <p>
Hope this helps someone.

  <title>Converting Org Files to Canvas Quizzes</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>May 24, 2024 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <h1 class="title">Converting Org Files to Canvas Quizzes
 <br></br> <span class="subtitle">May 24, 2024 00:00</span>
</h1>
 <p>
Oklahoma Baptist University, like many others, uses  <a href="https://www.instructure.com">Canvas</a> for a Learning Management System. There are many things I like about Canvas, but creating quizzes is not one of them. It is very difficult to do without constantly using the mouse, something that I find irritating and inefficient.
</p>

 <p>
Before we used Canvas, we used  <a href="https://moodle.org">Moodle</a>. One of the features that I really liked about Moodle was the ability to write tests in a simple format ( <a href="https://docs.moodle.org/403/en/GIFT_format">GIFT</a>) using a text editor that could be imported into the LMS. Canvas, on the other hand, can import QTI files, which can be created with a text editor, but, unfortunately, QTI is not a simple format. QTI files are fairly complex XML files. One of my projects this January was to write something to convert a simple text file to the QTI format needed for Canvas. Since I use Emacs, Org mode is the natural file type to use. The more that I looked into the QTI format, the more I realized that this is a project best left to the summer, not the short time between the Fall and Spring semesters. Still, my research revealed some other options:
</p>

 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>Geoffrey Poore’s  <a href="https://github.com/gpoore/text2qti">text2qti</a> converts Markdown files into QTI format quizzes. This would probably be the smart thing to use. I’ll experiment with it over the next few weeks.</li>
 <li>The  <a href="https://canconvert.k-state.edu/qti/">Classic to Canvas Converter</a> provided by Kansas State. This inputs a CSV file created with a spreadsheet, and outputs a QTI file that can imported into Canvas. It works well, using  <a href="https://dl.sps.northwestern.edu/canvas/2021/06/add-quiz-questions-to-canvas-by-converting-csv-files-to-qti-zip-files/">these instructions</a> provided by the Northwestern University School of Professional Studies.</li>
 <li>The  <a href="https://www.nyit.edu/its/canvas_exam_converter">Canvas Exam Converter</a> provided by the New York Institute of Technology. This has a text field in which can be pasted simply formatted text for the following question types: multiple choice, multiple answers, short answer, essay, and file upload. The tool checks for syntax errors, then converts the text to a QTI file and automatically downloads it.</li>
</ul> <p>
In the end, I’ll probably use text2qti, but for now, I’ve opted for the Canvas Exam Converter. I mostly use multiple choice and essay questions on my Canvas quizzes, but have occasionally also used multiple answer questions. So. the Canvas Exam Converter is more than enough for my needs. Here is an example using each of the five question types that the converter allows: 
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="orgba3b983">
1. Multiple choice question (single correct answer)
a) Wrong
b) Wrong
*c) Right
d) Wrong

2. Multiple choice question (several correct answers)
[*] Right
[ ] Wrong
[*] Right
[ ] Wrong

3. Short answer question
* Acceptable answer
* Another acceptable answer

4. Essay question
####

5. File upload question
^^^^
</pre>


 <p>
Now, this would be very simple to just type from scratch. Note that it is just a list with different styles of bullets for different kinds of questions, and Org mode is a very good tool for quickly creating lists. Org mode offers different options for the list indicators, and for each list type that converter requires, there is something very close to it in Org mode. To cycle through all of the options, put the point on a list item and enter  <code>C-c <right></code>. So, here’s the Org text that I decided to use:
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="orgc62ab15">
1. Multiple choice question (single correct answer)
   a) Wrong
   b) Wrong
   c) Right*
   d) Wrong
2. Multiple answer question (several correct answers)
   - [X] Right
   - [ ] Wrong
   - [X] Right
   - [ ] Wrong
3. Short answer question
   + Acceptable answer
   + Another acceptable answer
4. Essay question
   - ####
5. File upload question
   - ^^^^
</pre>

 <p>
The first thing to do is to allow letters for numbered lists in Org mode. <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>  This is done by adding this to the init file:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">( <span class="org-keyword">setq</span> org-list-allow-alphabetical t)
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Note that the correct answer to a multiple choice question is marked with an asterisk at the end of the option. Now, I just needed to do a few things, each accomplished easily with a regex search and replace:
</p>

 <ol class="org-ol"> <li>Remove the hyphens.</li>
 <li>Move the asterisk from the end of the correct multiple choice answer to the before the list item letter.</li>
 <li>Change each short answer “+” bullet to an asterisk.</li>
 <li>Change the multiple answer correct answer indicator to an asterisk.</li>
 <li>Remove the whitespace from the beginning of each line</li>
 <li>Add a blank line between each question.</li>
</ol> <p>
I’m sure that the third and fourth steps can be combined. For various reasons the converter didn’t like the blank lines at the beginning and the end, so I added a couple of steps to delete those. Initially, I had all of these replacements done on the text in the original buffer, requiring me to undo everything if I wanted to add something to the quiz. So, I decided it would be best to copy the Org text to a temp buffer, perform the replacements in the temp buffer, and copy the result to the clipboard ready to paste into the converter. To make things even easier, I have the function open the converter page in my default browser. In the end, the conversion function looks like this:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  ( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">convert-qti-nyit</span> ()

      )
    (browse-url  <span class="org-string">"https://www.nyit.edu/its/canvas_exam_converter"</span>)
    )
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
The file generated by the converter has to be compressed to a zip file before uploading the Canvas. In Mac OS, that’s done with a right-click on the file in the Finder and choosing the compress option. An advantage to using text2qti is that the conversion and compression could be automated using a shell script. Maybe that will be tomorrow’s project.

I didn’t realize this was possible at first. I initially used a numbered list for the multiple choice answers, then did five separate regex replaces, changing “1)” to “a)” and so on through “5)” to “e)”, and just resigned myself to adding any other options in Canvas itself. Changing the value of  <code>setq org-list-allow-alphabetical</code> to  <code>t</code> simplifies the conversion function and allows for an arbitrary number of answer options.

  <title>Org, Diary, and Dashboard</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <h1 class="title">Org, Diary, and Dashboard
 <br></br> <span class="subtitle">Jan 24, 2024 00:00</span>
</h1>
 <p>
When I’m not in class, most of my time is spent at my desk, with stacks of books, writing in Emacs. I also have a tendency to lose track of time when I’m focused on a problem. So, it would be nice to have something in Emacs to remind me of the start times of meetings and classes. That sent me down a two-day rabbit hole exploring the Emacs diary and getting deeper into Org mode.
</p>

 <p>
I won’t bother detailing all of the options that I tried, but here are the highlights:
</p>

 <ol class="org-ol"> <li>I first tried putting all of my appointments in Org mode. That seemed the natural thing to do, since I was already using it for task management. Unfortunately, I couldn’t figure out how to do simple things like creating recurring appointments that ended by a certain date, much less complex ones like a class that meets every Tuesday and Thursday except for Spring Break, conference breaks, etc.</li>
 <li>I then explored using the diary. The  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Format-of-Diary-File.html">diary file</a> has an extremely simple format; simple appointments are made just by listing the date, time, and appointment title on a line. Complex appointments are made by using special  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Special-Diary-Entries.html">sexp entries</a>, which allowed me to create the appointments for my courses. It is also very easy to display these appointments in org-agenda, which very conveniently marks the current time with a line across the agenda, providing a nice visual representation of the relative time before my next appointment. I didn’t quite like how the appointments were displayed in emphasized text, but everything else worked great. A reminder pops up in the minibuffer several minutes before the appointment. The pop-up reminder soon disappears, but the modeline continues to list, and update, the number of minutes until the appointment.</li>
 <li>Finally, as I researched how to form complex sexp appointments, I saw that Org mode is able to use the sexp appointment format. So, it was back to Org mode. Here is what I used in the end.</li>
</ol> <section id="outline-container-org58b6052" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="org58b6052">Init Settings</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org58b6052">
 <p>
I created an agenda display for just the current day:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-lisp">(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
    '(( <span class="org-string">"d"</span>  <span class="org-string">"Agenda for today"</span> agenda  <span class="org-string">""</span>
          ((org-agenda-overriding-header  <span class="org-string">"Today's agenda"</span>)
           (org-agenda-span 'day)
          ))))
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Next is to clear the existing appointment list when Emacs starts:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-lisp">(setq appt-time-msg-list nil)
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Then generate the appointment list from the Org agenda files and update it hourly:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-lisp">(org-agenda-to-appt)
(run-at-time  <span class="org-string">"24:01"</span> 3600 'org-agenda-to-appt)
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Finally, update the appointment list every time that an agenda is viewed:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-lisp">(add-hook 'org-finalize-agenda-hook 'org-agenda-to-appt)
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
An alert is issued 12 minutes before every appointment. This can be changed with  <code>(setq appt-message-warning-time 'n)</code>, where  <code>n</code> is the number of minutes desired. There are ways to generate system alerts using the  <a href="https://github.com/spegoraro/org-alert">Org Alert</a> package and others, but I only want something visible that counts down the time until I need to be somewhere. For this, the default appointment system works just fine.
</p>

 <p>
I use the  <a href="https://github.com/emacs-dashboard/emacs-dashboard">Emacs Dashboard</a> package. To display appointments, I found this function from  <a href="https://github.com/KaratasFurkan">Furkan Karataş</a> to insert the agenda view for the day:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-lisp">( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">dashboard-insert-agenda</span> ( <span class="org-type">&rest</span> _)
   <span class="org-doc">"Insert a copy of org-agenda buffer."</span>
  (insert (save-window-excursion
            (org-agenda nil  <span class="org-string">"d"</span>)
            ( <span class="org-keyword">prog1</span> (buffer-string)
              (kill-buffer)))))
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
I don’t need to see the time grid, just the current time and the appointment times:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-lisp">(setq org-agenda-time-grid
  '((daily today require-timed remove-match)
    ()
     <span class="org-string">"......"</span>
     <span class="org-string">""</span>))
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</section> <section id="outline-container-orgc62e8e0" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="orgc62e8e0">The Agenda File</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc62e8e0">
 <p>
I have two separate agenda files, one for tasks and another for events. Here’s how the event file is currently structured with an example or two in each category.
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-org"> <span class="org-org-level-1">* Birthdays and Anniversaries</span>

 <span class="org-org-sexp-date">%%(org-anniversary 2019 12 19) Lucy's %d%s birthday</span>

 <span class="org-org-level-1">* Classes</span>

 <span class="org-org-level-2">** Intro 12:30-13:45</span>
<%%(and (memq (calendar-day-of-week date) '(2 4))
   (diary-block 1 25 2024 5 10 2024)
   (not (or
        (diary-block 3 18 2024 3 22 2024)
        (diary-date 3 29 2024))))>

 <span class="org-org-level-1">* Recurring</span>

 <span class="org-org-level-2">** Edward 15:00</span>
 <span class="org-org-sexp-date"><%%(memq (calendar-day-of-week date) '(3))></span>

 <span class="org-org-level-1">* Future</span>

 <span class="org-org-level-2">** Total Eclipse </span> <span class="org-org-level-2"> <span class="org-org-date"><2024-04-08 Mon></span></span>
 <span class="org-org-level-2">** Colloquium </span> <span class="org-org-level-2"> <span class="org-org-date"><2024-02-09 Fri 15:00></span></span>

 <span class="org-org-level-1">* Past</span>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
All one-time appointments go under the future heading. Each appointment is simply a level-two heading that contains the appointment name and a timestamp. I haven’t yet decided whether I’ll later archive them or send them to “Past” with org-refile.
</p>

 <p>
The first example is for our dog’s birthday. The “%d” prints the number and the “%s” adds the ordinal ending. So, the agenda for December 19, 2023 contained “Lucy’s 4th birthday”. I also have entries for family birthdays and anniversaries.
</p>

 <p>
The second example is one of my classes this semester. At first, I struggled with where to put the time, until I realized that it doesn’t go in the sexp. Just put the appointment name and time in the sub-heading with the sexp below. In my file, I have the sexp formulas on one line, but I’ve split it up here to make it more readable. The first line means that this appointment is on Tuesdays and Thursdays. (Sunday=0, Monday=1, and so on.) The second line says that the appointment occurs only between January 25 and May 10, 2024, which are the beginning and end dates for our Spring semester. Conjoining these with “and” gives us all Tuesdays and Thursdays in the Spring semester. Next are lines with the exclusions, signified with “not”. The first exclusion is a block for spring break, and the second is one day that classes are cancelled. Note that these are in the scope of an “or” operator, meaning that a date is excluded if it meets at least one of these conditions.
</p>

 <p>
The recurring section is for any recurring appointment that is not a class. Note that this could have been done with something like this, if the appointment never changes:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-org"> <span class="org-org-level-2">** Edward </span> <span class="org-org-level-2"> <span class="org-org-date"><2024-01-24 Wed 15:00 +1w></span></span>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
I used the slightly more complicated formula because we will probably not meet in the summer, so it will be easy to add an exception block to the sexp.
</p>

 <p>
Finally, I added an org-capture template for easily creating simple appointments:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-lisp">( <span class="org-string">"e"</span>  <span class="org-string">"Event"</span> entry (file+headline  <span class="org-string">"path to events.org"</span>  <span class="org-string">"Future"</span>)
              <span class="org-string">"** %? %T"</span>)
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
This creates the appointment entry with a timestamp and puts the mark where the appointment name will go.
</p>

 <p>
There are many examples that can be found online, but few were of the type that I needed to see. I hope this helps someone else.

  <title>Beamer Article and Org Mode</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jul 04, 2024 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <h1 class="title">Beamer Article and Org Mode
 <br></br> <span class="subtitle">Jul 04, 2024 00:00</span>
</h1>
 <p>
I generate LaTeX Beamer lecture slides and handouts from a single Org mode data file. <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> The handouts include the information on the slides plus some extra explanation. I like to draw a box around the slide information so that students can easily differentiate the slides from the notes. I have scripts that export the Org file, generate the LaTeX files, then create the PDF’s. Everything seemed to work well so far, or at least I hadn’t noticed anything that wasn’t working. I’m teaching a course this summer that covers the same material in one day that I usually cover in three days during a regular semester. Ordinarily, I structure the presentation using only sections and slides, but stitching three of them together required adding subsections to keep everything clear. Adding subsections shouldn’t have been a problem, it’s just a matter of changing one line in the Org header from
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-org"> <span class="org-org-meta-line">#+OPTIONS: H:3</span>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
to
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-org"> <span class="org-org-meta-line">#+OPTIONS: H:2</span>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Unfortunately, this messed up the nice boxes around the slide material on the handouts. Suddenly, the boxes had completely disappeared. I didn’t understand why until I started looking at the LaTeX files. It turned out that I had been using tcolorbox to draw boxes around every block environment. Once I made the change, the slides were in a frame environment on the handouts, as they should have been. Easy fix, or so I thought — just change “block” to “frame” in the tcolorbox command. That brought the boxes back, but only around the slide titles, not around the slide contents.
</p>

 <p>
After many completely unproductive Internet searches, I stumbled on the problem. Org Beamer exports a slide to this LaTeX code:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-tex"> <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\begin</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">frame</span>}[label]{Slide Title}
  Slide contents
 <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\end</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">frame</span>}
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
This is fine for everything except my lecture handouts. I found that a small change to the LaTeX file completely fixed everything, though. All I needed to do was to change the frame environment to look like this:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-tex"> <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\begin</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">frame</span>}[label]
   <span class="org-font-latex-sedate">\frametitle</span>{Slide Title}
  Slide contents
 <span class="org-font-latex-sedate"> <span class="org-keyword">\end</span></span>{ <span class="org-function-name">frame</span>}
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Now, the problem was getting Org mode to export the subtree to look like that. After many, many more unproductive Internet searches, I learned that new Org exports could be made from pre-existing ones using org-export-define-derived-backend. Unfortunately, I couldn’t get it to work. Finally, it struck me that since I only needed to use frametitle for the handouts, a simple search and replace might be best. Adding this function to my compilation script worked:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-lisp">( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">rlr/create-frametitle</span> ()
   <span class="org-doc">"Convert title to frametitle."</span>
  (interactive)
  (goto-char 1)
  ( <span class="org-keyword">while</span> ( <span class="org-keyword">ignore-errors</span>
               (re-search-forward  <span class="org-string">"begin{frame}.*]"</span>))
    (insert  <span class="org-string">"\n \\frametitle"</span>))
  )
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
This finds a line containing “begin{frame}”, moves the point after the closing bracket of the label, inserts a new line then puts “\frametitle” before the slide title.
</p>

 <p>
Here’s the simple tcolorbox commands that go in the header:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-org"> <span class="org-org-meta-line">#+LaTeX_HEADER: \usepackage{tcolorbox}</span>
 <span class="org-org-meta-line">#+LaTeX_HEADER: \mode<article>{\setbeamertemplate{frame begin}{\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white, colframe=gray,]} \setbeamertemplate{frame end}{\end{tcolorbox}}}</span>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Simple enough, and only took four days….

 <p>
Auctex suddenly stopped loading yesterday. I saw hints that a makefile now had to be run, but I wasn’t sure where. I install packages using straight.el, which has a build and a repos directory. Running “make” in the straight/repos/auctex directory fixed everything.

 <p>
I’ve been tempted to do this for years, but have just now transitioned from Hugo to a pure Org mode blog. The process went much more smoothly than I expected, although I still need to convert old Markdown posts to Org mode. That will have to wait until the semester ends. I’ll write something soon explaining the transition.
</p>

 <p>
The site is still found at  <a href="https://randyridenour.net">randyridenour.net</a>.

  <title>Blogging with Org Mode</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Dec 17, 2024 00:00</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <h1 class="title">Blogging with Org Mode
 <br></br> <span class="subtitle">Dec 17, 2024 00:00</span>
</h1>
 <p>
This blog has been through many different versions. At various times, I’ve used WordPress, Ghost, Jekyll, and Hugo, some more than once. I’ve written posts in Markdown, HTML, Org mode, sometimes using more than one format in the same post. As Emacs users are prone to do, though, I’m constantly trying to do more in Org mode. I could write posts in Org mode for Hugo, but I’ve been tempted by the prospects of using Org to generate the entire site. I finally did it, and I’m pleased with the results so far.
</p>

 <p>
I started with the template provided by Sachin Patel that he describes  <a href="https://opensource.com/article/20/3/blog-emacs">here</a>. I have changed some things, so I’ll describe the site as I’ve put it together. I highly recommend reading his post and cloning a copy of the template, though. Everything is in a directory named “orgblog” that has the following structure:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-shell">.
├── css
│   └── stylesheet.css
├── docs
├── drafts
├── html-templates
│   ├── postamble.html
│   └── preamble.html
├── images
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   └── posts
├── org-templates
│   ├── latex-pdf.org
│   └── post.org
├── pages
│   ├── about.org
│   └── index.org
├── posts
│   ├── 24-12-05-sample-post.org
│   └── index.org
└── publish.el
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
I’ve included a sample post and an about page as examples. I left the two files in the “org-templates” directory unchanged from the template, other than changing the author’s name. I changed the HTML templates, removing the image and changing the menu from  <code>preamble.html</code>, with no significant changes to  <code>postamble.html</code>. Here is  <code>preamble.html</code>:
</p>


 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-html">< <span class="org-function-name">div</span>  <span class="org-variable-name">class</span>= <span class="org-string">"banner"</span>>

    </ <span class="org-function-name">ul</span>>
  </ <span class="org-function-name">nav</span>>
</ <span class="org-function-name">div</span>>
</pre>
</div>


 <p>
All the work gets done by the  <code>publish.el</code> file. Here are some changes that I made to the template. First, since I’m the sole author, I don’t need “Published by…” by every post title on the index page. 
</p>


 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">me/website-html-preamble</span> (plist)
   <span class="org-doc">"PLIST: An entry."</span>
  ( <span class="org-keyword">if</span> (org-export-get-date plist this-date-format)
      (plist-put plist
                  <span class="org-builtin">:subtitle</span> (format  <span class="org-string">"%s"</span>
                                   (org-export-get-date plist this-date-format)
                                   (car (plist-get plist  <span class="org-builtin">:author</span>)))))
</pre>
</div>


 <p>
I made some slight changes to the  <code>org-publish-project-alist</code>. First, I added a posts directory to help keep things organized. I also added a pages directory, instead of using a directory for each individual page. I also changed every reference to the “public” folder to “docs”, since Github pages will serve a site from a directory title “docs”. Here are the entries for posts and pages — all of the others are basically the same as the template except for changing “public” to “docs”.
</p>


 <div class="org-src-container">

          <span class="org-builtin">:html-postamble</span> me/website-html-postamble)
</pre>
</div>


 <p>
I have a folder for drafts that doesn’t get an entry in the  <code>=project-alist</code>. When I’m ready to publish a draft, I have a function that copies it to the posts directory and deletes it from the drafts directory.  I don’t use the  <code>serve.el</code> or the  <code>makefile</code> from the template. Instead, I use the  <code>org-publish-all</code> function to build the site and  <code>serve</code> from npm to serve a local copy. I dropped a copy of  <a href="https://neat.joeldare.com">Neat CSS</a> into the CSS folder and modified the  <code>me/website-html-head</code> variable in  <code>publish.el</code> to reflect that.
</p>

 <p>
Here are the functions I use to build, serve, and deploy. To build the site, I run
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">orgblog-build</span> ()
  ( <span class="org-keyword">interactive</span>)
  ( <span class="org-keyword">progn</span>
    (find-file  <span class="org-string">"~/sites/orgblog/publish.el"</span>)
    (eval-buffer)
    (org-publish-all)
    (kill-buffer)))
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
This function starts the server, waits for a second, then opens the default browser to localhost:
</p>


 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">orgblog-serve</span> ()
  ( <span class="org-keyword">interactive</span>)
  ( <span class="org-keyword">progn</span>
    ( <span class="org-keyword">let</span> ((default-directory  <span class="org-string">"~/sites/orgblog/docs"</span>))
          (async-shell-command  <span class="org-string">"serve"</span>)
          (sleep-for 1)
          (async-shell-command  <span class="org-string">"open http://localhost:3000"</span>))))
</pre>
</div>



 <p>
If everything, looks good, then I can push changes to Github. The fish function  <code>orgblog-push</code> changes to the site directory, adds all modifications, creates a commit with a default message, pushes the remote, then displays the current status of the repo.
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">orgblog-push</span> ()
  ( <span class="org-keyword">interactive</span>)
  (async-shell-command  <span class="org-string">"orgblog-push"</span>))
</pre>
</div>


 <p>
This moves a draft to the posts directory by saving the buffer, copying it to posts, moving the original to the trash in case something goes wrong, and killing the buffer. It then opens the posts directory in Dired.
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">publish-orgblog-draft</span> ()
  ( <span class="org-keyword">interactive</span>)
  (save-buffer)
  (copy-file (buffer-file-name)  <span class="org-string">"~/sites/orgblog/posts/"</span>)
  (delete-file (buffer-file-name) t)
  (kill-buffer)
  (dired  <span class="org-string">"~/sites/orgblog/posts"</span>))
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Finally, posts have these header lines:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-org"> <span class="org-org-document-info-keyword">#+TITLE:</span>  <span class="org-org-document-title">Sample Post</span>
 <span class="org-org-document-info-keyword">#+date:</span>  <span class="org-org-document-info"><2024-12-05 Thu></span>
 <span class="org-org-meta-line">#+filetags: blog emacs org</span>
 <span class="org-org-meta-line">#+setupfile: ../org-templates/post.org</span>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
I’m very happy with how things have turned out, and this should be enough to help others do the same. I’ve been converting old posts to the new format and still have some 250 to go. That’s giving me plenty of opportunities to develop my regex skills. The source for the site can be found on Github  <a href="https://github.com/rlridenour/rlridenour.github.io">here</a>.

  <title>Making Tag Pages in an Org Mode Blog</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <h1 class="title">Making Tag Pages in an Org Mode Blog
 <br></br> <span class="subtitle">Dec 30, 2024 00:00</span>
</h1>
 <p>
I have finished converting the old Hugo blog to the new org-publish format. It was quite a bit of work, but I tried to automate as much as possible. I wrote about the initial setup  <a href="./2024-12-17-blogging-with-org-mode.html">here</a>. One minor change has been to remove the “home” and “up” links that org-publish inserts at the upper-right. This just requires a simple change to the  <code>org-publish-project-alist</code>:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"> <span class="org-builtin">:html-link-home</span>  <span class="org-string">""</span>
 <span class="org-builtin">:html-link-up</span>  <span class="org-string">""</span>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Just make sure to change them wherever they occur in the alist.
</p>

 <p>
A bigger issue was displaying post tags and creating tag pages. Tag and category pages in Hugo were fairly simple. Every time the site was built, Hugo would create the tag pages reflecting any new tags. Unfortunately, I could find no way to automatically do this with org-publish. My first thought was to simply forego tagging since there is a blog archive page with links to every post. A search on that page can find whatever you need,  <i>if</i> you happened to know what you needed to search for. It’s not a good way to simply browse an area of interest, however.
</p>

 <p>
On the other hand, making tags manually was never going to work for me either. That would require manually adding tags to the post, being sure to use the same names for tags across posts. Otherwise, I’d end up with some posts tagged “org” and others tagged “org-mode”. Then, I’d have to create a new tag page if needed, make a link from the post to the tag page, then another link from the tag page back to the tagged post. There’s no chance I could, or would, consistently make that happen. Fortunately, though, because this is Emacs, everything is scriptable.
</p>

 <p>
Keep in mind that I’m a philosopher, not a coder. Here are my steps to solving a problem:
</p>

 <ol class="org-ol"> <li>Figure out what I want.</li>
 <li>Find someone who has posted something close to what I want.</li>
 <li>Make changes to their code to make it do what I want.</li>
 <li>Keep hacking at it until it works.</li>
 <li>Realize that what I thought I wanted wasn’t really what I wanted, so return to step 1 and repeat until satisfied.</li>
</ol> <p>
So, the result is likely to be sloppy and inefficient, but it generally works in the end. I started with this post from  <a href="https://christiantietze.de/posts/2022/07/emacs-blogging-insert-tag-yaml-frontmatter-posts/">Christian Tietze</a>, who solved my first problem of consistently using tags across the site. From him, I got these three functions:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">orgblog-all-tag-lines</span> ()
   <span class="org-doc">"Get filetag lines from all posts."</span>
  ( <span class="org-keyword">let</span> ((post-dir orgblog-posts-directory)
            (regex  <span class="org-string">"^#\\+filetags:\\s([a-zA-Z]+)"</span>))
    (shell-command-to-string
     (concat  <span class="org-string">"rg --context 0 --no-filename --no-heading --replace \"\\$1\" -- "</span> (shell-quote-argument regex)  <span class="org-string">" "</span> post-dir))))

( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">orgblog-all-tags</span> ()
   <span class="org-doc">"Return a list of unique tags from all posts."</span>
  (delete-dups
   (split-string (orgblog-all-tag-lines) nil t)))

( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">orgblog-select-tag</span> ()
   <span class="org-doc">"Select and insert a tag from tags in the blog."</span>
  ( <span class="org-keyword">defvar</span>  <span class="org-variable-name">newtag</span>)
  ( <span class="org-keyword">setq</span> newtag (completing-read  <span class="org-string">"Tag: "</span> (orgblog-all-tags))))
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
The first uses  <code>ripgrep</code> to get all of the filetag lines from the headers in the posts directory. The second splits those lines into a list of separate words and deletes the duplicates. The third displays the list and allows the user to select a tag to be assigned to a variable. The only things I believe I’ve changed here are variable names. I also explicitly search the posts directory rather than the current directory since I write posts initially in a drafts directory. Since the tags are separated by a space in each filetag line, I can use the default value for  <code>split-string</code>. If the desired tag is not on the list, just hit  <code>return</code> and the new tag gets assigned to the variable.
</p>

 <p>
At this point, I had to venture on my own into unknown waters. First, I needed to insert the new tag into the post. There’s no real reason to keep the filetag lines, except that I might find a better way to use them in the future. So, I add the new tag to the end of the filetag line. I need to display it in the published post, though, so each post has a line at the end <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> that begins with “Tagged:”. This function handles that:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">insert-post-tag</span> ()
  (orgblog-select-tag)
  (beginning-of-buffer)
  (search-forward  <span class="org-string">"#+filetags"</span> nil 1)
  (end-of-line)
  (insert (concat  <span class="org-string">" "</span> newtag))
  (beginning-of-buffer)
  (search-forward  <span class="org-string">"Tagged:"</span>)
  (end-of-line)
  (insert (concat  <span class="org-string">" [[file:../tags/"</span> newtag  <span class="org-string">".org]["</span> (s-titleized-words newtag)  <span class="org-string">"]]"</span>)))
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Note that I use Sveen Magnars’  <a href="https://github.com/magnars/s.el">s.el</a> library to capitalize the tag names for display. The next thing to do is to add the tagged post to the tag page. To do that, I use this function:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">add-post-to-tagfile</span> ()
  ( <span class="org-keyword">defvar</span>  <span class="org-variable-name">tagfile</span>)
  ( <span class="org-keyword">defvar</span>  <span class="org-variable-name">post-filename</span>)
  ( <span class="org-keyword">defvar</span>  <span class="org-variable-name">post-title</span>)
  ( <span class="org-keyword">setq</span> tagfile (concat  <span class="org-string">"../tags/"</span> newtag  <span class="org-string">".org"</span>))
  ( <span class="org-keyword">setq</span> post-filename (f-filename (f-this-file)))
  ( <span class="org-keyword">progn</span>
    (beginning-of-buffer)
    (search-forward  <span class="org-string">"#+title: "</span> nil 1)
    ( <span class="org-keyword">setq</span> post-title (buffer-substring (point) (line-end-position))))
  ( <span class="org-keyword">when</span>
      (not (file-exists-p tagfile))
    (f-append-text (concat  <span class="org-string">"#+title: Tagged: "</span> (s-titleized-words newtag)  <span class="org-string">"\n#+setupfile: ../org-templates/post.org\n"</span>) 'utf-8 tagfile))
  (f-append-text (concat  <span class="org-string">"\n- [[file:../posts/"</span> post-filename  <span class="org-string">"]["</span> post-title  <span class="org-string">"]]"</span>) 'utf-8 tagfile))
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
To create the links, we’ll need the filename and title of the post. We’ll also need the filename for the tag page. Note that this function uses both the  <a href="https://github.com/magnars/s.el">s.el</a> and Johan Andersson’s  <a href="https://github.com/rejeep/f.el">f.el</a> libraries. In short, here’s what the function does:
</p>

 <ol class="org-ol"> <li>Create the filename for the tag page in the tags directory.</li>
 <li>Get the filename for the post.</li>
 <li>Extract the post title from header title-line.</li>
 <li>Create the file for the tag page if necessary.</li>
 <li>Add a link to the post at the bottom of the tag page.</li>
</ol> <p>
The final thing is to put all of functions together into one interactive function:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">orgblog-add-tag</span> ()
  ( <span class="org-keyword">interactive</span>)
  (orgblog-select-tag)
  (insert-post-tag)
  (add-post-to-tagfile)
  (save-buffer))
</pre>
</div>


 <p>
The only thing left to do manually is to add a new tag page to the index page of the tags directory. I’m sure I could automate that with some effort, but at this stage I hardly ever use any new tags, so I’m not convinced that it would be worth the effort.
</p>

 <p>
The only minor glitch in the system is that, for some reason, I have to press  <code>return</code> twice to select the tag. I’m not sure why. Eventually it will bother me enough to figure it out.

  <title>Creating an RSS Feed</title>

 <p>
I struggled with ox-rss for my blog feed and really could never get it working. It would generate an RSS file, but for some reason, the feed readers wouldn’t get anything. I don’t know enough about XML to fix it, and I had neither the time right now nor the inclination to learn.
</p>

 <p>
So, I stumbled across  <a href="https://github.com/emacsmirror/webfeeder">Emacs Webfeeder</a>, which creates a feed from the HTML files. After adding it with use-package, I removed the RSS component of my  <code>publish.el</code> file, and changed by blog build function to this:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">orgblog-build</span> ()
  ( <span class="org-keyword">interactive</span>)
  ( <span class="org-keyword">progn</span>

                            <span class="org-string">"https://randyridenour.net/"</span>
                           ( <span class="org-keyword">let</span> ((default-directory (expand-file-name  <span class="org-string">"./docs"</span>)))
                               (remove  <span class="org-string">"posts/index.html"</span>
                                         (directory-files-recursively  <span class="org-string">"posts"</span>
                                                                             <span class="org-string">".*\\.html$"</span>)))
                            <span class="org-builtin">:title</span>  <span class="org-string">"Randy Ridenour"</span>
                            <span class="org-builtin">:description</span>  <span class="org-string">"Blog posts by Randy Ridenour"</span>)
    (kill-buffer))
  (message  <span class="org-string">"Build complete!"</span>))
</pre>
</div>


 <p>
After building the site, Webfeeder generated an  <code>atom.rss</code> file, and everything works fine. That was the last critical component of my endeavor to blog with Emacs only.

 <p>
Today is the first day of the spring semester. We used to have a separate term in January that I never taught, so the Christmas break seemed especially short this year. 
</p>

 <p>
One wonderful thing about teaching is that every semester is a new beginning, another opportunity to finally get everything right.

  <title>Dot Operators for Logical And</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <h1 class="title">Dot Operators for Logical And
 <br></br> <span class="subtitle">Jan 12, 2025 12:59</span>
</h1>
 <p>
My logic textbook this semester uses a dot for “and” instead of an ampersand. Unfortunately, the center dot in LaTeX is too small to be easily legible. I managed to increase the size of the LaTeX cdot by using the bm package and renewing the command to   <code>\bm{\cdot}</code>. In some cases, such as social media and the web, it’s easier to use a unicode symbol. Here are the obvious options:
</p>

 <dl class="org-dl"> <dt>Dot Operator</dt> <dd>(A ⋅ B)</dd>
 <dt>Bullet Operator</dt> <dd>(A ∙ B)</dd>
 <dt>Bullet</dt> <dd>(A • B)</dd>
</dl> <p>
The bullet seems slightly more legible. Here’s how it looks in a more complex formula:
</p>

 <div class="org-center">
 <p>
∼[A • (B ∨ C)] ⊃ (B • ∼D)
</p>
</div>

 <p>
I don’t see any downside to using the bullet.

  <title>Replicating Emacs Everywhere with Keyboard Maestro</title>

 <br></br> <span class="subtitle">Jan 20, 2025 18:16</span>
</h1>
 <p>
I’ve always loved the idea of Tecosaur’s  <a href="https://github.com/tecosaur/emacs-everywhere">Emacs Everywhere</a>, but when I looked at the code it seemed like quite a bit of overhead for someone who just uses one operating system. I tried to pull out just the portions relating to the Mac, but couldn’t make it work. I’ve been running  <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a> for a long time now thinking that maybe someday I would use it to automate something. Since I couldn’t bring myself to watch the inauguration today, it seemed like a good idea to finally use it.
</p>

 <p>
As always, I’ll start with this disclaimer: I am an amateur elisp hack. I borrow and steal from others, cobbling things together that never initially work, then fiddle with them until they finally do what I had intended. With that out of the way, here’s what I put together. 
</p>
 <section id="outline-container-org85582e5" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="org85582e5">Notepad Mode</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org85582e5">
 <p>
I wanted to use  <code>C-c C-c</code> to easily quit and return to the initial application. The easiest way for me to do this was to create a new mode. Since I write everything with Org mode, it makes sense to just use it with a different name. I also defined a new keymap that calls a function that is defined below.
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">( <span class="org-keyword">defvar-keymap</span> notepad-mode-map
   <span class="org-string">"C-c C-c"</span> #'copy-kill-buffer)

( <span class="org-keyword">define-derived-mode</span>  <span class="org-function-name">notepad-mode</span>
  org-mode  <span class="org-string">"Notepad"</span>
   <span class="org-doc">"Major mode for scratch buffers."</span>
  )
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
This creates a temporary scratch buffer, sets it to notepad mode and pastes the contents, if any, of the system clipboard.
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  ( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">rlr-create-notepad-buffer</span> ()
     <span class="org-doc">"Create a new notepad buffer."</span>
    ( <span class="org-keyword">interactive</span>)
    ( <span class="org-keyword">let</span> ((buf (generate-new-buffer  <span class="org-string">"*notepad*"</span>)))
      (switch-to-buffer buf))
    (notepad-mode)
(shell-command-on-region (point) ( <span class="org-keyword">if</span> mark-active (mark) (point))  <span class="org-string">"pbpaste"</span> nil t))
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
After finishing writing the desired text in the notepad buffer, this function adds a new line at the end, copies the contents of the buffer, kills it, then runs an application that does nothing but beep twice and exits. 
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">copy-kill-buffer</span> ()
  ( <span class="org-keyword">interactive</span>)
  (goto-char (point-max))
  (newline)
  (mark-whole-buffer)
  (copy-region-as-kill 1 (buffer-size))
  (kill-buffer)
   <span class="org-comment-delimiter">;; </span> <span class="org-comment">(app-switch)</span>
  (shell-command  <span class="org-string">"open -a ~/icloud/scripts/beep.app"</span>))
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Beep.app is one line of AppleScript:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-applescript">beep 2
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</section> <section id="outline-container-orgdb769d9" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="orgdb769d9">Keyboard Maestro</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdb769d9">
 <p>
The piece that puts it all together is a Keyboard Maestro macro. It builds on a macro that I found by  <a href="https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/u/cdthomer/summary">Chris Thomerson</a> on  <a href="https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/t/going-back-to-previous-application-window/17963/6">this thread</a> in the Keyboard Maestro forum. <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> His macro has two action groups. The first saves the current front application and window to variables before minimizing the front window. The second executes an AppleScript that activates the application named by the variable, then unminimizes the window and brings it to the front.
</p>

 <p>
Before the first action group, I inserted another group that first clears the system clipboard. It then cuts any selected text in the current front window.
</p>

 <p>
In between Thomerson’s two macro groups, I have another group that activates my terminal app and runs this fish function that starts an emacsclient instance, opens a notepad buffer, and brings Emacs to the front.
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-fish"> <span class="org-keyword">function</span>  <span class="org-function-name">notepad</span>
     <span class="org-builtin">emacsclient</span> -e  <span class="org-string">"(rlr-create-notepad-buffer)"</span>
     <span class="org-builtin">open</span> -a emacs
 <span class="org-keyword">end</span>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
It then pauses the macro until that simple beep application is run.
</p>

 <p>
The last action is to paste the new clipboard text back into the original application front window.
</p>

 <p>
So, in short, here is what happens when I press the hot key that calls the macro:
</p>

 <ol class="org-ol"> <li>Copy any selected text from the front window</li>
 <li>Open an Emacs buffer containing the copied text, if any.</li>
 <li>Kill the Emacs buffer and paste its contents back into the previous front window.</li>
</ol> <p>
People seem to think that Emacs should only be used by ancient programmer wizards, and that those of us who are less technically minded should stick with something more modern and pre-packaged. I’ve found, though, that writing very useful Emacs functions is as simple as stringing commands together. What Emacs does is let even humanities professors like me do things they could never imagine doing with another editor.
</p>

 <p>
For those who are interested, here’s a picture of the entire macro:

  <title>Attendance Sheets in Org Mode</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Jan 25, 2025 07:17</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <h1 class="title">Attendance Sheets in Org Mode
 <br></br> <span class="subtitle">Jan 25, 2025 07:17</span>
</h1>
 <p>
This is another one of those days when I realized that I have been doing things the hard way. For years, I have been generating attendance sign-in sheets with Org Mode wonderful table editor. I would split the names into two columns and add a signature column after each. To ensure there was enough room for the signature, I would then stretch the signature column by adding phantom text to one of the rows like this (the names are from  <a href="https://1000randomnames.com">1000randomnames.com</a>):
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-org"> <span class="org-org-table">| Miley Malone | </span> <span class="org-org-table"> <span class="org-org-latex-and-related">\phantom{</span></span> <span class="org-org-table">xxxxxxxxxx} | Ruben Espinosa | </span> <span class="org-org-table"> <span class="org-org-latex-and-related">\phantom{</span></span> <span class="org-org-table">xxxxxxxxxx} |</span>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Then, to make sure there was enough vertical space, I would add some extra blank rows between each row, having to adjust several times to make everything fit. It worked fine once completed, but it was certainly a pain in the neck. After seeing Matt Maguire’s post,  <a href="https://www.teachmaths.org/20250117_orgmode-tables/">Exporting Org Mode Tables to LaTeX</a>, I realized there had to be a better way. 
</p>

 <p>
Using the LaTeX  <a href="https://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/tabularray/tabularray.pdf">tabularray</a> package, I can simply do this:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-org"> <span class="org-org-meta-line">#+ATTR_LATEX: :environment tblr :align hline{3-Z}={solid},row{2-Z}={f,12mm},colspec={XXXX}</span>
 <span class="org-org-table">| </span> <span class="org-org-table"> <span class="org-bold">Name</span></span> <span class="org-org-table">         | </span> <span class="org-org-table"> <span class="org-bold">Signature</span></span> <span class="org-org-table"> | </span> <span class="org-org-table"> <span class="org-bold">Name</span></span> <span class="org-org-table">         | </span> <span class="org-org-table"> <span class="org-bold">Signature</span></span> <span class="org-org-table"> |</span>
 <span class="org-org-table">| Miley Malone   |             | Ruben Espinosa |             |</span>
 <span class="org-org-table">| Braylee Brandt |             | Naomi Warren   |             |</span>
 <span class="org-org-table">| Abel Bullock   |             | Winnie Weaver  |             |</span>
 <span class="org-org-table">| Tucker Sexton  |             | Ellen Hayden   |             |</span>
 <span class="org-org-table">| Leroy Skinner  |             | Damir Phillips |             |</span>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
to produce:
</p>

 <div class="org-center">

 <div id="org17b410c" class="figure">
 <p> <img src="../images/posts/tblr-attendance.png" alt="tblr-attendance.png" width="100%"></img></p>
</div>
</div>

 <p>
Here is what the values of  <code>align</code> do:
</p>

 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>Ordinarily,  <code>hline</code> puts a border line on the top and bottom of every row. I don’t want them on the first row, so  <code>hline{3-Z}={solid}</code> omits the first two lines.</li>
 <li> <code>row{2-Z}={f,12mm}</code> aligns the text to the bottom of the row and sets the row height to 12mm for all of the rows except for the first.</li>
 <li> <code>colspec={XXXX}</code> widens the row to the length of the line. Since the signature columns are blank, I don’t really need to specify particular column widths.</li>
</ul> <p>
Now, instead of inserting and deleting rows and setting horizontal lines manually, I can just adjust the row height as needed by changing one number. See the excellent tabularray documentation for other settings.

  <title>Duplicate Org Beamer Title Slides</title>
  <author><name>Randy Ridenour</name></author>
  <summary>Feb 12, 2025 04:08</summary>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <h1 class="title">Duplicate Org Beamer Title Slides
 <br></br> <span class="subtitle">Feb 12, 2025 04:08</span>
</h1>
 <p>
I recently noticed two problems with my LaTeX Beamer lecture slides that I create using Org mode. First, I suddenly had duplicate title slides. My template began with this:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-org"> <span class="org-org-level-3">*** </span>
 <span class="org-org-latex-and-related">\maketitle</span>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Deleting that fixed the problem. I guess it just automatically inserts a title slide now. Second, my section and subsection slides weren’t being created. Looking at the  <code>*.tex</code> file showed that the sections were using the  <code>section*</code> variant. Telling the org file to number the sections fixed the problem. Here’s the line to use:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-org"> <span class="org-org-meta-line">#+OPTIONS: num:t</span>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Modifying my  <a href="https://github.com/rlridenour/beamer-themes">Beamer theme</a> also fixed the problem. Evidently, it’s pretty simple to specify what should be done with the starred sections in this way:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-latex"> <span class="org-font-latex-sedate">\AtBeginSection</span>[<text for starred sections>]{<text for unstarred sections}
</pre>
</div>

  <title>Emacs&apos; Undeserved Reputation</title>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<main id="content" class="content"> <h1 class="title">Emacs’ Undeserved Reputation
 <br></br> <span class="subtitle">Mar 02, 2025 18:19</span>
</h1>
 <p>
In a post titled “ <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12813">Is Emacs Hard to Configure</a>” on his blog Irreal, JCS  discusses the oft-heard complaint that Emacs is difficult to configure. He objects, rightly so in my opinion, saying that many non-programmers also use Emacs. The post on Irreal was prompted by  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1ixfhja/my_emacs_config/">this discussion</a> on Reddit. User precompute claimed that Emacs is not hard to configure,  <i>so long as you understand Elisp</i>. Several responded that the need to understand Elisp is exactly the problem. I am one of those non-programmers who use Emacs, and somehow even I manage to use it to do my work.
</p>

 <p>
I admit that I wouldn’t have been able to do some of the more complex things in my config file without the help of the many generous people in the Emacs community who constantly share their knowledge with others. This means that for any configuration problem you might have, it’s very likely that someone has already explained in detail how to solve it. It probably is easier to set the font in other text editors; in VSCode, for example, open the settings, select the font menu, and type in the font family in one text field and the font size in another. That is admittedly simpler than what I have in my Emacs config, but a quick search for “Emacs set font” reveals pages and pages of results, each explaining how it’s done. That means a new user can learn how to set the font in nearly the same time as it takes to do it in any other editor. 
</p>

 <p>
I admit that my claiming that Emacs being only slightly more difficult to configure than other text editors does not amount to a good case that someone should consider using Emacs. The power of Emacs, in my opinion, is that you can, with a little Elisp, make it do nearly  <i>anything</i> that you want to do with text. How much Elisp? The answer is very little, actually. Whenever I find myself repeatedly using the same series of commands, I create a command that does the same thing with a single command. This only requires learning to write simple functions. For a very simple example, I often would delete a window, then balance the remaining windows in the frame. This is just two commands, but there’s no reason why I have to execute both myself. I can simply string them together into a custom command like this:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">delete-window-balance</span> ()
     <span class="org-doc">"Delete window and rebalance the remaining ones."</span>
    ( <span class="org-keyword">interactive</span>)
    (delete-window)
    (balance-windows))
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
I have other examples that are more complex, but they’re still just instances of taking ordinary Emacs commands and combining into a workflow that meets the needs of the particular user. This is ridiculously simple in Emacs, but I suspect it would be much more difficult in another editor.

 <p>
When her daughter announced that she intended to learn to read, Rum Godden wrote this letter to her:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
You see, when you learn to read you will be born again into another world and it is a pity to be born again so
young. I should put off reading, if I were you. As soon as you learn to read you will not see anything again quite
as it is. It will all the time be altered by what you have read and you will never be quite alone again. I should
stay by yourself a bit longer if I were you. 
</p>
</blockquote>
