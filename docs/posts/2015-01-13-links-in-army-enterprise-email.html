This will probably be useful to only a few people, but maybe it will help someone who is frantically searching the internet for an answer.

Roughly a year ago, the Army changed its email service to an Exchange Enterprise system. The old address, which I have had for years (decades?) forwards to the new address, which I never can seem to easily remember. It seems, though, that links in forwarded emails are stripped out for security purposes. This is not a problem if the url is visible in the message, like this:
</p>

<p>
<code>http://google.com</code>
</p>

<p>
One can simply copy and paste the url into the browser. If the link is embedded into text or a graphic, though, there is nothing to copy. Any link seems to go to
</p>

<p>
<code>https://web-cols01.mail.mil/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx</code>
</p>

<p>
This makes it impossible to retrieve the original linked URL.
</p>

<p>
The problem that I had was with the Microsoft Home Use Program (HUP), which sells copies of Microsoft Office to military members at a very low price. For various reasons, I don&rsquo;t like using Office, but it&rsquo;s what the military uses, and I occasionally need it. Of course, to verify eligibility, the email had to be sent to a .mil address, and the link couldn&rsquo;t be opened. I tried forwarding the email to a Gmail account, but the links were still broken.
</p>

<p>
The solution was to select &ldquo;Options&rdquo; for the message, and forward it <i>as an attachment</i> to Gmail. The links were still broken, but broken in a way that the original URL could be retrieved. After forwarding as an attachment, the link to Google would be
</p>

<p>
<code>blockedhttp://google.com</code>
</p>

<p>
Just copy the link, paste it in, and delete the word &ldquo;blocked&rdquo; before pressing the enter key.
</p>

<p>
It only took two months to figure that out. It might be better if I&rsquo;d simply learn the new Enterprise address.
