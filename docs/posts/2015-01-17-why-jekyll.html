It must be that time of year again — the time that I do something new with the blog. I&rsquo;m not sure that I could remember all of the tools that I&rsquo;ve used to build web sites in the past:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Microsoft FrontPage (Those were dark days, indeed.)</li>
<li>Something that I vaguely remember being produced by Netscape</li>
<li>RapidWeaver</li>
<li>Blogger</li>
<li>RubyFrontier</li>
<li>Wordpress</li>
<li>Octopress</li>
<li>Statamic</li>
<li>Ghost</li>
<li>Squarespace</li>
</ul>

<p>
I&rsquo;m probably forgetting something, but you get the point. The problem is that none of these met all of my criteria for a good system. The last four are definitely viable, each have strengths and weaknesses. With Wordpress, Ghost, and Squarespace, I was able to post from my iPad when I didn&rsquo;t have access to the computer. With Octopress, I was able to keep an up-to-date copy of all posts in their native Markdown format. Posting from iOS with Octopress was possible, but tricky. With Squarespace, I could write the original post in my preferred text editor, then copy and paste into the Markdown field. If I later edited the post online, I would have to remember to update the stored file on the computer. I could download a backup, but it was an XML file, no longer Markdown. Statamic is a good solution, and if I had to design a site for a non-tech-savvy client, I would probably go with it.

<h2 id="orgce12740">What I&rsquo;m Looking For</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgce12740">
<p>
Here are the features I wanted:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Inexpensive — I teach at a private, tuition-driven, liberal arts college.</li>
<li>Write in Markdown.</li>
<li>Write with Emacs.</li>
<li>Use some Markdown extension for footnotes<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> and tables.</li>
<li>Typeset math with MathJax.</li>
<li>Easily keep an updated copy of all posts in their native format.</li>
<li>Occasionally write and publish a post with my iPad.</li>
<li>Control over the aesthetics of the site.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="http://scriptogr.am">Scriptogram</a> looked ideal, with posts built from Markdown files kept in Dropbox. The problem is that services like Scriptogram have been shutting down, because they weren&rsquo;t sustainable. There are some services that looked like they had a plan for sustainability, like <a href="https://www.silvrback.com ">Silvrback</a> and <a href="https://posthaven.com ">Posthaven</a>, but they didn&rsquo;t seem to meet my needs any better than Ghost.
</p>

<p>
I copied everything from Squarespace and built an Octopress site, deciding to live with the mobile posting problem. Octopress seems to take a bit of time to build, which could be annoying as the site gets larger, but that&rsquo;s a minor complaint. <a href="http://hexo.io ">Hexo</a> is fast, but most of the users seem to be Chinese, and like Blanche DuBois, I tend to rely on the kindness of strangers, at least I rely on others to have written about how to solve certain problems.
</p>

<section id="outline-container-org96b3c86" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org96b3c86">Jekyll to the Rescue</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org96b3c86">
<p>
I&rsquo;ve played with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com ">Jekyll</a> in the past, but didn&rsquo;t find it very friendly unless packaged in Octopress. I decided to give Jekyll another try. It turned out to be fairly easy to set up, and I believe it has all of the features that I wanted. I&rsquo;m publish to Github Pages, so it&rsquo;s free. I&rsquo;m using an extension of Markdown called Kramdown that has footnotes, tables, and MathJax support. I not only have a local copy of my posts, but they&rsquo;re all under version control, backed up on Github. I found a very nice theme that I was able to use to fairly closely replicate my Squarespace site. Finally, I can write and publish a post on the Github web site, which is then copied to my computer the next time I publish. Of course, Emacs is able to automate much of the process.
</p>

<p>
So, here is the new Jekyll site.
</p>

<p>
UPDATE: I should have mentioned that the day I deployed the new Jekyll site, Brandon Mathis posted information about <a href="http://octopress.org/2015/01/15/octopress-3.0-is-coming/">Octopress 3</a>.
</p>

<p>
It sounds interesting, and I&rsquo;ll have to keep an eye on it. I saw <a href="http://www.websrvr.in/?utm_source=getsimpleform.com&amp;utm_medium=nav&amp;utm_campaign=simpleform1%20">websrvr</a> this morning. It builds from Dropbox, but is a paid service, so it might be something that sticks around.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> It certainly looks worth a test run.

It&rsquo;s only one dollar per month, so the cost is insignificant. I certainly like free, but I&rsquo;m leery of depending on something when I can&rsquo;t figure out how the people responsible are managing to pay their bills.
