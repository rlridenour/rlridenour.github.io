The parable of the Good Samaritan is prompted by a lawyer&rsquo;s question in Luke 10:29, &ldquo;But wanting to justify himself, he asked Jesus, &lsquo;And who is my neighbor?&rsquo;&rdquo;   That phrase, &ldquo;But wanting to justify himself&rdquo; plays an important role in a sermon of mine, where I claimed that this places the lawyer on par with the typical caller on a talk-radio show. On this reading, the phrase means something like, &ldquo;In order to impress those listening in,&rdquo; or &ldquo;In order to sound smarter than he really was.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m no longer confident, though, that I&rsquo;ve been fair to the lawyer. Why would any 1st-century Jew have asked what the greatest commandment was? Everyone would have agreed that it is found in Deuteronomy 6:5, &ldquo;You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>
And given the themes in the prophets and the law, Jesus&rsquo; claim that the second greatest commandment was the requirement to love one&rsquo;s neighbor as oneself  in Leviticus 19:18 would also strike listeners as obvious. 
</p>

<p>
So, the lawyer, having just asked a question to which everyone listening would have though the answer was obvious, then proceeded to ask another question with an even more obvious answer, &ldquo;Who is my neighbor?&rdquo;  Maybe the lawyer suspected that God&rsquo;s commandment was more radical than we ever assumed. 
</p>

<p>
Maybe the lawyer was present four chapters earlier, when Jesus uttered these words, &ldquo;But I say to you that listen, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this for the past few days after hearing Mitch Randall&rsquo;s sermon at <a href="http://northhavenchurch.net">NorthHaven Church</a> on loving our enemies. What would Jesus have said if the same lawyer were to have asked, &ldquo;Who is my enemy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sixteen months in a combat zone taught me that identifying enemies can be difficult. It is not in the enemy&rsquo;s best interests to be identifiable as an enemy. It may also be that I am the one who is antagonistic, but self-deceptive about the extent and nature of my antagonism. Even if I have them, it may be difficult for me to see myself as a person who makes enemies.
</p>

<p>
So, how do I begin to understand who my enemy is? Maybe I should begin by answering these questions:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In whose failure would I take pleasure?</li>
<li>At whose expense do I direct my humor?</li>
<li>To whom do I need to feel superior?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Sometimes we feel like we are surrounded by enemies. I fear that they are enemies that we have constructed for our own sake. 
</p>

<p>
Lord have mercy.
