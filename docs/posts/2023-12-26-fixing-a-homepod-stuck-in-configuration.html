<p>
I&rsquo;ve had a HomePod Mini in my home office for about six months now that has been working great. I&rsquo;m really impressed with the audio produced by such a small speaker. I&rsquo;ve been wanting another one to try out a stereo pair, so I put it on my Christmas list. Installing the first one was simple, but installing the second was frustrating. I connected it to power, and scanned the light with my iPhone. The HomePod went through a set-up process, offered to pair to the first, but the stereo pairing never worked. I noticed that the Home app said that the new HomePod was being configured and full functionality would be available shortly, but it never finished. I also notice that the old HomePod was on version 17.2 of the HomePod software, but the new one was still on version 16.0. So, as one does in such cases, I turned to the Internet for solutions. Evidently, this is a common problem, especially with HomePods on version 16.0 of the software. and here are some of the potential solutions that I found.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Unplug for at least ten seconds, then reconnect to power. The HomePod should update. (It didn&rsquo;t).</li>
<li>Change your location setting in iCloud to something else, update the HomePod, and then change the location to the original setting. (I found that you can&rsquo;t change your location setting until you first cancel Apple One and other subscriptions, which I did not want to until I was absolutely desperate.)</li>
<li>Install the HomePod into a temporary new home in the Home app.</li>
<li>Connect the new HomePod to a Mac and update in the Finder.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A combination of the last two worked. Here are the steps that I remember doing, if you ever find yourself in the same position:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Connect the HomePod to a Mac. Select it when it shows up in the Finder sidebar, and choose to restore it. It will then update to the latest version of the software.</li>
<li>Remove the old HomePod from the Home app by selecting it in the Home app, selecting &ldquo;Reset HomePod&#x2026;&rdquo;, and then selecting &ldquo;Remove Accessory&rdquo;. (I don&rsquo;t know if this was necessary, but it&rsquo;s what I did.)</li>
<li>Add a new home in the Home app by first clicking on the circle with three little dots inside in the top right corner. In the &ldquo;Home Settings&rdquo; page, you&rsquo;ll find &ldquo;Add Home&rdquo; in the top left. Name it anything you like.</li>
<li>Add the new HomePod to the new home. After the installation process is finally complete, move the new HomePod to the old home, by selecting the HomePod and choosing &ldquo;Remove Accessory&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Add the new HomePod to the original home. Then, I added the old Homepod as a stereo pair. After everything was working, I then deleted the new temporary home from the Home app.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Hope this helps someone.
