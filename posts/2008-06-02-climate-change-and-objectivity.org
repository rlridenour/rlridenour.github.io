The [[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/02/AR2008060202698.html?wpisrc=newsletter" title="Climate Findings Were Distorted, Probe Finds - washingtonpost.com][/Washington Post/]] reports something today that is unfortunate but unsurprising. NASA's inspector general has determined that political appointees have controlled and distorted information about research on climate change conducted by NASA scientists. This is why it is so difficult for the layperson like myself to make informed decisions about the severity of the problem and the best response to the problem. Such decisions should be made on the basis of the best science, but what we know about the science has been distorted by those who have already decided what is to be done.
