It’s interesting that the prominent atheist [[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/3255972/Harry-Potter-fails-to-cast-spell-over-Professor-Richard-Dawkins.html][Richard Dawkins]] is now claiming that reading J.K. Rowling’s /Harry Potter/ books is dangerous for children.

I never thought I would see Richard Dawkins taking the same position as conservative Christians.
