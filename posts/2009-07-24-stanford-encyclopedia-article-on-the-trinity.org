#+title: Stanford Encyclopedia Article on the Trinity
#+filetags: philosophy religion

Dale Tuggy has a new [[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/trinity/][article]] in The /Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy/ on the Trinity. In my opinion, [[http://plato.stanford.edu/][/The Stanford Encyclopedia/]] is the best reference work in philosophy, not simply the best online reference work in philosophy. I’ve been slowly working on a paper on the Trinity, so I’m grateful to have a nice summary of recent work on the subject.
