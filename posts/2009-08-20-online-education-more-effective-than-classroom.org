[[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/19/study-finds-that-online-education-beats-the-classroom/][Online education more effective than classroom?]]

From the /NY Times/: "A recent 93-page report on online education, conducted by SRI International for the Department of Education, has a starchy academic title, but a most intriguing conclusion: 'On average, students in online learning conditions performed better than those receiving face-to-face instruction.'"
    
Surprising.
