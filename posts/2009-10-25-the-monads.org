#+title: The Monads

From the "[[http://tar.weatherson.org/][Thoughts, Arguments, and Rants]]" blog, here is a link to a band called "[[http://people.umass.edu/phil511/monads/][The Monads]]" and it's reincarnation, "The 21st Century Monads." No educated person could resist songs with titles like "The Skeptic Song" and "The Missing Shade of Blues." There's even a song expressing the emotional depths of the academic life: "My Paper Was Rejected Again."
