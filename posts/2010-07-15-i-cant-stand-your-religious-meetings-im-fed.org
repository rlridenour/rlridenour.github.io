I can't stand your religious meetings.\\
I'm fed up with your conferences and conventions.\\
I want nothing to do with your religion projects,\\
your pretentious slogans and goals.\\
I'm sick of your fund-raising schemes,\\
your public relations and image making.\\
I've had all I can take of your noisy ego-music.\\
When was the last time you sang to me?\\
Do you know what I want?\\
I want justice—oceans of it.\\
I want fairness—rivers of it.\\
That's what I want. That's all I want.
