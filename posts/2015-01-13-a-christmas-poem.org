#+title: A Christmas Poem

A hundred mile journey\\
from Nazareth to Bethlehem,\\
taken at the whim\\
of the emperor.\\

And two people,\\
who never counted to Caesar,\\
walked for days\\
to be counted by Caesar.

But Caesar rested easily in his palace,\\
not feeling the earth tremble\\
as the weight of the universe\\
was laid in a manger.
