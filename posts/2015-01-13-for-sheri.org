For Sheri on her birthday:

"Did you get\\
a good-morning\\
kiss?"\\

I ask.

"No, I don't think so."

You reply,\\
even though I\\
know that's not true.

Some couples won't\\
speak for years\\
because of some\\
small lie.

So, how do\\
I feel?

Like a kid\\
who just heard

"No school - it's\\
a snow day today."\\

Like a person\\
who reached into\\
his jacket pocket\\
on the first day\\
of fall,

and pulled out\\
two twenty-dollar\\
bills.

Those people just\\
think they have\\
all the luck.

I know better\\
though,\\

because it's\\
been over\\
thirty years,\\

and

just one kiss\\
is still\\
not enough.
