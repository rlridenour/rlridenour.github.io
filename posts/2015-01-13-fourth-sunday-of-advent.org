#+title: Fourth Sunday of Advent

Sometimes it seems\\
like the world\\
is filled\\
with a darkness\\
that threatens\\
to shatter our lives\\
and destroy all hope,

but as our eyes\\
are opened in worship\\
we see that this darkness\\
is but a shadow that flees\\
as the light of Christ\\
comes into the world.

May your light shine upon us,\\
may it shine in us,\\
may it shine through us.

/Amen/
