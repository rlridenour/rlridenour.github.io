#+title: Prayer for Compassion

/For the Second Sunday of Pentecost/

Isaiah spoke\\
Of one who was\\
Ugly,\\
Despised,\\
Rejected,

One who knew pain,\\
And suffering,

One upon whom people would look,\\
Then turn away in disgust.

Yet it was our pain he bore,\\
And our ugliness he assumed,\\
Taking upon himself\\
The shameful things inside\\
That we keep hidden.

We are like those\\
Who saw only a homeless, itinerant Rabbi,\\
But failed to see the one\\
In whom the glory of God shone,\\
When we see those who make us uncomfortable,\\
And fail to see ones\\
Whom you love\\
And created in your image.

God of grace and compassion,\\
Forgive us.\\
Open our eyes that we may see.\\
Open our hearts that we may love.

/Amen/
