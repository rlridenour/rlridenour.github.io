#+title: Prayer for Easter

We hear Jesus say,\\
\\
"Love your enemies,\\
Turn the other cheek,\\
Sell all you have,\\
Give to the poor,\\
Don't worry,\\
Forgive,\\
Be not afraid."\\
\\
\\
We reply,\\
\\
"Surely, he didn't mean what he said.\\
We can't,\\
It's not natural,\\
It's impossible."\\
\\
Then Easter comes,\\
And we are left speechless.\\
\\
May your beauty draw us,\\
Your power strengthen us,\\
And your love compel us\\
To live fully as citizens of your kingdom.\\

/Amen/
