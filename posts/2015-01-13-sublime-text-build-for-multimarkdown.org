#+title: Sublime Text Build for MultiMarkdown

I added some variants to Brett Terpstra's Marked.sublime-build file, which is part of the Marked [[http://brettterpstra.com/introducing-the-marked-bonus-pack/][Bonus Pack]]. It adds options for building tex, opml, and odf files. To build a tex file, open the command palette and search for "MMD to LaTeX." The file is saved as "Marked.sublime-build" in =/Users/YourUserName/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages=. Here is the complete build file:


#+begin_example yaml
{
	"cmd": ["open","-a","/Applications/Marked.app","$file"],
	"selector": "text.html.markdown",

	"variants": [
		{
			"cmd": ["mmd2tex", "$file"],
			"path": "/usr/local/bin",
			"name": "MMD to LaTeX"
		},

		{
			"cmd": ["mmd2odf", "$file"],
			"path": "/usr/local/bin",
			"name": "MMD to ODF"
		},

		{
			"cmd": ["mmd2opml", "$file"],
			"path": "/usr/local/bin",
			"name": "MMD to OPML"
		}

	]
}

Happy New Year!
