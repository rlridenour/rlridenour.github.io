Lord Jesus,\\
\\
What kind of king are you?\\

The kingdoms of this earth\\
Pride themselves on their power,\\
Their majesty,\\
Their influence,\\
And their wealth.\\

Yet you say that your kingdom is like\\
A small seed,\\
Yeast,\\
And a net.\\

May your kingdom fill our lives\\
As the yeast permeates the dough.\\
As we grow from this small seed\\
May we provide shelter and shade to those in need,\\
Yet remaining rooted in you,\\
And drawing nourishment from your compassion.\\

And when the day comes,\\
We pray that you will\\
Catch us in your net of love,\\
Drawing us to our eternal home\\
In your arms.\\
\\
/Amen/
