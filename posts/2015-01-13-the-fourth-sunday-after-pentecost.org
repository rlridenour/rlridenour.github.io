#+title: the Fourth Sunday after Pentecost

Holy God,

For those times\\
when we hear\\
the ridicule,\\
the jeers,\\
the insults,\\
and see the looks\\
of pain and loneliness,\\
yet stand in uncomfortable silence,\\
and do nothing,

Lord have mercy.

And for those times\\
when we strike back\\
at those who hurt us,\\
and start another\\
cycle of violence\\
that has no end in sight,

Christ have mercy.

The powerful rested\\
easy on their thrones,\\
when the things of God\\
were bought and sold\\
on the marketplace;\\
for the temple\\
was their palace,\\
and its religion\\
was their power.

Lord Jesus,\\
storm into our lives\\
as you did the temple;\\
may the chains be broken,\\
the tables turned,\\
and our hearts set free.

/Amen/
