#+title: The Nineteenth Sunday After Pentecost

Here I am, Lord,\\
asking for just\\
one more chance.

Why do you continue to use me?
What good am I to you?

I am a\\
flawed,\\
broken,\\
undependable\\
tool.

One that makes mistakes,\\
and asks for second chances.

But I hear a gentle voice\\
whispering a message of hope,\\
that my heart longs to hear...

That even a flawed and broken tool\\
can make something beautiful\\
when it's used by the master.

/Amen/
