/A prayer prompted by the deacon ordination service at NorthHaven Church, April 27, 2014./

Lord Jesus,

Children take what is given them\\
With joy and gratitude,\\
Without pretense,\\
Never second-guessing\\
The motives of the giver.

You told us that we must\\
Receive the Kingdom as a little child,\\
Yet our pride keeps us from accepting\\
That which you offer by the hands of your servants.\\
Teach us to receive the gifts of ministry\\
That you so graciously provide.

/Amen/
