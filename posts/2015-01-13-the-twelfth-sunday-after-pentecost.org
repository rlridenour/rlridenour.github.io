#+title: The Twelfth Sunday After Pentecost

Loving God,

Apathy is a vice\\
easily disguised\\
behind veils\\
of busy lives,\\
carefully built\\
to avoid the\\
demands of love.

Forgive me,\\
not just because\\
I pretend to care,\\
but that I\\
deceive myself -\\
believing in\\
the pretending\\
more than\\
in the caring.

/Amen/
