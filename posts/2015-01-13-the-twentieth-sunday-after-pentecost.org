#+title: The Twentieth Sunday After Pentecost

I want a faith\\
that is like\\
a good pair of shoes.

Comfortable,\\
not too demanding,\\
painless,\\
and safe...

Easy to forget...

The kind you never\\
know is there,\\
with just a little Jesus,\\
and not too much of the Spirit.

A faith that trusts,\\
but not too much.\\
A faith that dreams,\\
but not too big.

But the living God\\
does not deal in small faith\\
and small dreams.

So, here I am, Lord,\\
opening up the dry,\\
dusty corners of my heart.

Let the river flow.

/Amen/
