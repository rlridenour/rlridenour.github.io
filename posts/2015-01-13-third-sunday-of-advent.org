This is a prayer I wrote for the Christmas special at NorthHaven Church today:

Holy God,

Once again,\\
the angels invite us\\
to come,\\
behold,\\
and adore.

Now may your spirit of peace\\
quiet our minds,\\
prepare our hearts,\\
and open our eyes\\
this Christmas season\\
that we may see\\
the beauty of the Savior\\
as if for the very first time.

And then, as we run to Bethlehem in joy\\
to worship the newborn King,\\
may we do so\\
knowing that the tiny arms\\
that reached out to Mary\\
are the same arms that were stretched out\\
to redeem the world;

And the song that the angels sang\\
is but a shadow of the one\\
that all creation will sing\\
in the world to come:

Gloria in excelsis Deo,

Glory,\\
Glory,\\
Glory to God in the highest!

/Amen/
