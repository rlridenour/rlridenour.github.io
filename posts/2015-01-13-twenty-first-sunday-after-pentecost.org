#+title: Twenty-First Sunday After Pentecost

Lord,

Stay with me\\
for a moment\\
while I divide\\
up my life.

I'll give you Sunday,\\
but I'm keeping\\
Monday through Saturday.

I'll give you ten percent,\\
so long as you don't\\
ask what I do with\\
the other ninety.

I'll do whatever you ask,\\
just don't make any\\
unreasonable demands.

Then, in the stillness,\\
I hear a quiet voice\\
whisper the question\\
I'm afraid to answer:

"Why do you call me 'Lord?'"

Lord, have mercy.

/Amen/
