#+title: Twenty-Second Sunday After Pentecost

Merciful God,

This day marks the end of the war\\
that was to be the last.\\
That we thought it so was just\\
another sign of our arrogance.\\

We use this day now\\
to give thanks for\\
those who have served.

And as we remember them,\\
let us not do so\\
through the eyes of the world,\\
which values only\\
security,\\
power,\\
and wealth.

Let us look instead\\
through the eyes of\\
the Crucified One,\\
who looks upon us\\
with\\
humility,\\
sacrifice,\\
and love.

For it is only then\\
that we understand\\
the cost borne\\
by those who have\\
"No greater love\\
than this."

/Amen/
