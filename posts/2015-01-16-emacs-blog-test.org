#+title: Emacs Blog Test

I'm testing blogging to the new Jekyll blog from Emacs using the Lisp code from [[https://www.miskatonic.org/2014/01/26/more-about-emacs-and-jekyll/ ][William Denton]].
It works extremely well. I had to remap the key definitions since =C-c j= was already used for something else in my configuration. It's bad Emacs form, but I used =C-x j= instead. So, =C-x j n= asks for a post title, then creates a file in the drafts folder with the front matter already inserted. When ready to publish, =C-x j t= inserts the time stamp, and =C-x j p= renames the file using the time stamp and moves it into the posts folder. =C-x j o= opens the site folder in a dired buffer.
