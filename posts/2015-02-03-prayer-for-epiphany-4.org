#+title: Prayer for Epiphany 4


Jesus,

You found a man living in a cemetery,\\
bound by chains that he did not forge,\\
forced on him by people who were afraid.

I, too, am bound in chains,\\
some forged by ignorance,\\
every link a failure to recognize\\
your image in another human.

Others forged by arrogance,\\
of thinking that there are those\\
not fit for your kingdom,\\
or for your service.

Still others forged by fear,\\
the fear of rejection,\\
the fear of difference.

You who created the world\\
in all of its diversity\\
and declared it to be good,

Free me from the arrogant presumption\\
of thinking that I would have done better.

/Amen/
