Lord Jesus,\\

As I find myself\\
grasping for more,\\
even though I\\
surely have enough,

I hear the voice\\
of the Spirit whisper,\\
"Is this how you\\
follow the one\\
who had no place\\
to lay his head,\\
whose only robe\\
was taken from him\\
and gambled away?"

May I never confuse\\
the abundant life\\
with an empty\\
life of abundance.

/Amen/
