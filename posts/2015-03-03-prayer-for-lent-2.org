#+title: Prayer for Lent 2

I see a man\\
sleeping on a bench\\
in the cold,

And I say,

"Thank you, Lord,\\
for I am not like him."

I see a woman\\
alone, in tears,\\
mourning,

And I say,

"Thank you, Lord,\\
for I am not like her."

I see a man\\
upon a cross,\\
humiliated, scorned,\\
despised,

And suddenly my\\
foolish pride is clear\\
even to me,

And I cry,

"Forgive me, Lord,\\
for I am not like you."

/Amen/
