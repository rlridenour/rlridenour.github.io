#+title: Prayer for Lent 5

A woman asked Jesus\\
to heal her daughter,\\
and Jesus said nothing.

Pilate asked Jesus\\
to defend himself,\\
and Jesus said nothing.

Yet the girl was healed,\\
and Jesus went to the cross.

Forgive me, Lord,\\
for the sin of\\
saying everything but\\
doing nothing.

/Amen/
