#+title: Palm Sunday 2015

With praise and palm branches,\\
the people celebrated\\
their new freedom\\
from their Greek overlords.

And in a new century,\\
and under a new empire,\\
the people once again\\
wave the palm branches\\
and cheer for a new hero.

Jesus rode into Jerusalem\\
and the people cheered,\\
but Jesus wept,\\
for they could not see\\
that the Jesus for whom we cheer\\
is not the same Jesus\\
that we behold upon the cross\\
in silence, and in awe.

Father, forgive us\\
for seeing only\\
the messiah that we want,\\
and not the messiah that we need.

/Amen/
