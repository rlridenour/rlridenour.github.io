#+title: Good Friday Prayer

Tiny gold crosses\\
hang from sparkling\\
gold chains,\\
signs of\\
wealth, affluence,\\
and good taste,\\
compared to\\
a large wooden cross\\
covered in blood,\\
an instrument of torture,\\
a symbol designed\\
to bring terror\\
to enemies of the state.

On this day, Lord,\\
give me a vision\\
of the horror of the cross,\\
for without it\\
there is no beauty\\
of the cross.

/Amen/
