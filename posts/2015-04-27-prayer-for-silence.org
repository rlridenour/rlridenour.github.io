#+title: Prayer for Silence

Holy God,

There are times when\\
we just have no words,\\
times of great beauty,\\
or times of great suffering.

But our silence\\
makes us uncomfortable,\\
and we feel that\\
we must say something,\\
so we fill the silence\\
with meaningless noise\\
and empty chatter.

So, when we feel the urge\\
to trivialize the sublime\\
with our vain babbling,\\
give us the strength\\
to cover our mouths\\
and stand before\\
your holiness\\
in silence\\
and in awe.

/Amen/
