/A poem for Memorial Day, 2015, written after conducting a funeral at the Dallas-Fort Worth National Cemetery, April 23, 2015./

The boy stared, amazed\\
at the ranks and files\\
of perfect straight lines.\\

Each member stood\\
at attention, a silent and still\\
granite memorial to one\\
who was a child once

before youth was taken,\\
leaving only scars

if anything at all.
