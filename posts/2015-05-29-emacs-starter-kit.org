#+title: Emacs Starter Kit

The first week of a break from classes is always a good time for a massive reconfiguration of something tech-related. Last time it was the blog, this time it is Emacs. Since I primarily use Emacs only for LaTeX and Markdown editing, I though I would give Kieran Healy's [[https://kieranhealy.org/resources/emacs-starter-kit/][Emacs Starter Kit for the Social Sciences]] a try. He has done a masterful job of setting up a great LaTeX editing machine. Easy to install, and easy to customize.
