#+title: Prayer for Trinity Sunday


Triune God,

In those times\\
that we feel alone,\\
lost in the crowd,\\
and disconnected\\
from those around us,\\
we take comfort in knowing\\
that at the center of reality\\
is an unending community of love,\\
and that we, your children,\\
have been invited into\\
the eternal fellowship\\
that is the\\
Father,\\
Son,\\
and Holy Spirit,\\
three persons,\\
but one God,\\
forever and ever.

Amen
