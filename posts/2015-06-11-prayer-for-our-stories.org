#+title: Lives are Stories — A Prayer


Gracious God,\\
who knows us better\\
than we know ourselves,

Forgive me,\\
when I quickly judge\\
a harsh word,\\
or impolite response\\
without knowing\\
the full story.

Everyone has a story,\\
and every encounter\\
affects the plot,\\
and each moment\\
is another opportunity\\
to transform the tale\\
from hopeless tragedy\\
to divine beauty.

/Amen/
