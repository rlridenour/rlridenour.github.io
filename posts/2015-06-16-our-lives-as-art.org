#+title: Our Lives as Art


Great God of beauty and wonder,

There are days when I wish\\
that you had given us\\
a blueprint for life,\\
with every step\\
mapped out in detail,\\
and every decision\\
already made.

Instead, you gave us\\
each a life for a canvas,\\
and gifts and talents\\
for a palette and brushes,\\
the Spirit for our guide,\\
and the Son for our model,\\
then you sent us out\\
into the world to paint.

Now, with the loving eye\\
of the great artist who painted\\
the night sky with stars,\\
help us to create something beautiful\\
with you.

/Amen/
