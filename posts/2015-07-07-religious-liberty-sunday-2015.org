#+title: Religious Liberty Sunday, 2015


As I listened to Mitch Randall's sermon last Sunday at NorthHaven Church in Norman, Oklahoma, I couldn't help but reflect on Paul's words in Philippians 2. I hope the prayer for the week reflects that thought.

Father,

Protect us from the arrogance\\
of unwarranted certainty,\\
as it keeps us from hearing\\
the voice of our neighbor.

Cleanse us from the vanity\\
of inflated self-importance,\\
as it moves us to see only ourselves.

May we never desire a freedom\\
that forces others to worship as we do,\\
for that is not the way of the one\\
who took up, not his rights,\\
but the cross.

In his name,\\
/Amen/
