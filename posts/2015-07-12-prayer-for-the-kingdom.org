#+title: Prayer for the Kingdom


God of Hope,

My lips say,\\
"Thy Kingdom come,\\
Thy will be done...,"

But my heart says,

"My will,\\
my world,\\
and my way."

How can I pray for your Kingdom,\\
when I am not yet willing\\
to relinquish my own?

Loosen my grip on myself,\\
that I may open my arms\\
to embrace your vision\\
for this world.

/Amen/
