#+title: Pie in the Sky

Another thought-provoking sermon this morning by Mitch Randall​ at [[http://northhavenchurch.net/][NorthHaven Church]]​.
[fn:1] Nietzsche's main criticism of the church in his day was that it was simply about the world to come, and that a religion that was of no value in this world now was of no value at all — a sentiment articulated in Joe Hill's poem "The Preacher and the Slave":

#+begin_quote
Long-haired preachers come out every night,\\
Try to tell you what’s wrong and what’s right;\\
But when asked how ’bout something to eat\\
They will answer with voices so sweet:\\
\\
You will eat, bye and bye,\\
In that glorious land above the sky;\\
Work and pray, live on hay,\\
You’ll get pie in the sky when you die....

When Jesus read a Jubilee text from Isaiah in the synagogue at Nazareth, he didn't say that someday this would be fulfilled, but that it was fulfilled "today."

May it be so, even today.
