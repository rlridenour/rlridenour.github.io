#+title: For the Moments of Darkness

Loving God,\\
Source of light in our darkness,\\
\\
We give thanks for the light of your love\\
that shines within us, through us, and around us.\\
\\
When the darkness threatens to overcome us,\\
and we fear that we may lose our way,\\
\\
When our spirits are broken,\\
and we no longer can find hope,\\
\\
Help us to hear the voice\\
that spoke the light into being\\
and called it good,\\
\\
And give us the strength\\
to lift our voices with John the Apostle\\
and declare unto the world\\
that the light still shines in the darkness,\\
\\
And the darkness has not,\\
will not,\\
and cannot\\
overcome it.\\

/Amen/
