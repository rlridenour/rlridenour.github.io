God of grace,

On the door of the church,\\
Luther proclaimed his message,

"The true treasure of the church\\
is the most holy gospel\\
of the glory and grace of God."

A treasure too great\\
to be kept to ourselves,\\
yet why is that\\
we who have received\\
so much grace somehow\\
seem to have so little\\
left to offer?

Forgive me, Lord,\\
and let me never again\\
confuse your river of grace\\
with the cesspool of\\
my self-righteousness.

/Amen/
