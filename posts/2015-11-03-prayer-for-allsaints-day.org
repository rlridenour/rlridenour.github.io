#+title: Prayer for All Saints Day

Lord,\\

We search for heroes\\
among the rich, powerful,\\
strong and proud â€”\\
those who look more\\
like the crucifiers\\
than the crucified.\\

But on this day,\\
we give thanks\\
for those for whom\\
loving is more important\\
than being loved,\\
and faithfulness more\\
dear than fame.\\

Not our idols, Lord,\\
instead, your saints.\\

/Amen/
