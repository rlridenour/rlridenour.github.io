#+title: To Dance Without Care

Lord Jesus,

You invite us\\
to lay down our\\
burdens, cares, concerns,\\
fears, and anxieties,\\
and give them all to you.

Then, wrapped in the\\
sweet warmth of your grace,\\
we can dance in joy\\
before the throne,\\
as beloved children\\
of the Father\\
who have finally\\
found their way home.\\

/Amen/
