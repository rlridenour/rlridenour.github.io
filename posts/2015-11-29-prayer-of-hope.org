#+title: Prayer of Hope

*For the First Sunday of Advent*

God of all hope,

When those seeking food and shelter\\
are told only to pray to Jesus,

When those fleeing the devastation of war\\
are told only to go to Jesus,

And when those who\\
have lost all hope\\
are told only to hope in Jesus,

Then, Lord, I have failed.

For if I will not welcome\\
those whom the world now rejects,\\
then why would I welcome the child\\
whom the world did reject?

So, instead of the usual\\
empty platitudes of the season,\\
may I offer real hope,\\
a hope that feeds,\\
clothes, and shelters,\\
heals broken lives,\\
and mends broken spirits.

In the name of Christ,

/Amen/
