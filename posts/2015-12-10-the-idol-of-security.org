#+title: The Idol of Security

God of Peace,

There was a time when\\
we built idols of stone\\
that separated us from you.

Now, we are tempted\\
to build new idols,\\
walls that separate us\\
from those created\\
in your own image.

Forgive us, Lord,\\
for loving our own safety\\
more than we love the gospel,\\
and for sacrificing\\
the dream of true peace\\
on the altar of a\\
false sense of security.

/Amen/
