#+title: Prayer for the Joy of Advent

God of joy,

A cacophony of voices\\
demand our daily attention,\\
some calling us to\\
the bitter resignation\\
of despair, others, to the\\
sweet, but empty, vanity\\
of self-righteousness.

Joy, though, speaks with\\
a quiet and unassuming voice,\\
much like a babe born\\
to poor parents and\\
laid in a manger to sleep.

Cleanse my heart\\
of the cynicism that\\
blocks the empty noise\\
of the season,\\
at the expense\\
of the possibility\\
of hearing the joy\\
of Advent.

/Amen/
