#+title: Strength and Wisdom

A prayer after a week in which I had made prior commitments for four straight evenings following the thirty hour trip back from Ghana:

Grant us, Lord,\\
the strength and energy\\
to do those things\\
that we've agreed to do,\\
and the wisdom to know\\
when to agree to something\\
in the first place.

Amen
