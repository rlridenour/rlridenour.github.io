#+title: Prayer for Ash Wednesday

Holy God,

You call us into the night,\\
into the darkness,\\
to a place without distraction\\
where we can see only ourselves,\\
not as we wish we were,\\
but as we truly are.

We come hesitantly,\\
for we are afraid\\
to acknowledge\\
what we have become.

We come trembling,\\
knowing that hearts\\
that are hard\\
must somehow be broken.

We come with hope,\\
knowing that what\\
is broken can\\
again be made whole\\
by the unending\\
love of God.

/Amen/
