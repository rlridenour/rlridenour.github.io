#+title: Prayer for New Life

A prayer for the First Sunday of Lent:

Father,

The dying tree,\\
desperate to stay alive,\\
tries to maintain\\
the illusion of being\\
healthy and full,\\
but it cannot\\
hide the truth,\\
for it saps life from\\
everything around it.

Forgive me,\\
for I take much\\
more than I give,\\
and like the tree,\\
never truly live.

May these roots\\
once again taste\\
the goodness of\\
your grace, and\\
these branches\\
be a blessing\\
to all that\\
I encounter.

/Amen/
