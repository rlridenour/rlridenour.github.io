#+title: Truth, Beauty, and Peace

Father,

There are days\\
when it seems\\
like I'm creating\\
a minefield with\\
carefully placed\\
hazards of\\
discord,\\
ugliness,\\
and lies.

Help me instead\\
to plant seeds of\\
truth,\\
beauty,\\
and peace;\\
building a place\\
where others can\\
run without care â€”\\

Barefoot,\\
with joy,\\
in the fields\\
of the Lord.
