#+title: Rejecting Exclusion

Blessed Lord,

You warned us of a broad path\\
that leads to destruction,\\
a path that so many seem to be walking.

It is an easy path\\
that calls us to\\
give in to our temptations\\
to hate, despise, and fear,\\
to become something less\\
than what you have created us to be.

You have called us to a higher path,

to renounce fear,\\
and proclaim faith,

to cast off hatred,\\
and put on love,

to reject exclusion,\\
and embrace the world\\
with open arms as wide\\
as those that stretched out\\
upon the cross for us,

but not just for us.

/Amen/
