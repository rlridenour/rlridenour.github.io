#+title: Prayer for Maundy Thursday

Father,

Examine my heart,\\
show me my deepest desire.

Is it to be great,\\
safe,\\
secure,\\
invincible,\\
and strong?

Or is it to follow Jesus?

To build my protective fortress,\\
or to risk loving my neighbor?

To demand my rights,\\
or to take up the cross?

Not my will, but yours be done.

/Amen/
