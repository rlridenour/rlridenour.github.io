Gracious Father,

Holy Saturday,\\
the day of waiting,\\
after all of our\\
hopes and dreams\\
have been crushed\\
by a cruel world\\
and a naive idealism\\
is forced to succumb\\
to a harsher reality.

But even after the\\
horrors of Friday,\\
the morning sun still\\
rose on Saturday.

And we have hope,\\
however faint,\\
however absurd.

So we wait,\\
wait to see\\
what Sunday\\
will bring.

Amen
