#+title: Thomas the Faithful

Lord Jesus,

You warned the disciples\\
to be wary of claims\\
that the messiah had come.\\
You said, "When told\\
he is in the inner rooms,\\
do not believe it."

When Thomas was told\\
that you appeared\\
in the inner rooms,\\
he heeded your word\\
and did not believe it\\
until he saw for himself.

And of those who claim\\
to have special insight\\
of your will for us,\\
may we be like Thomas,\\
the skeptical and\\
obedient disciple.

/Amen/
