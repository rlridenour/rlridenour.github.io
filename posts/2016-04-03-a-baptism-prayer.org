#+title: A Baptism Prayer

Thank you, Lord,\\
for showing us that\\
the Gospel still speaks,\\
that the Spirit still calls,\\
and that people still respond,

Today, it is one who,\\
by the act of baptism,\\
calls us to recover\\
the excitement and hope\\
of our first calling.

As her faith grows,\\
so may ours also.

We can only dream of what\\
you have in store for her,\\
may the Church have the wisdom\\
to at least not get in the way.

/Amen/
