#+title: The Fear of Risk

Gracious God,

We live in fear\\
of failure and\\
disappointment,\\
afraid that we\\
might say or do\\
the wrong thing.

Paralyzed by risk,\\
we simply do nothing\\
and remain silent.

But who am I,\\
blind as I am,\\
to judge what does\\
or does not fail?

Help me to trust in you,\\
the one who makes all things\\
work together for good,\\
for, to, and through\\
those who love you.

/Amen/
