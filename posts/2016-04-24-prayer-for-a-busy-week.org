#+title: Prayer for a Busy Week

Father,

We live in a world\\
with walls both\\
visible and invisible;\\
some protect us from harm,\\
and others protect\\
us from inconvenience,\\
hearing only the voices\\
that reinforce our fears.

Open a window in the walls,\\
so that we may hear the voice\\
of the one who needs to be heard,\\
who speaks in a still, small voice\\
so often drowned out by our noisy lives.

/Amen/
