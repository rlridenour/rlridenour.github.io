#+title: For Those Who Are Labeled

Almighty God,\\
Lord of all,\\
both the actual\\
and the possible,

I am indignant when\\
labeled by others,\\
put into a box\\
built by those\\
with no idea of\\
who I really am.

And so I define myself,\\
enjoying my freedom\\
to choose my own labels,\\
but even I have no idea\\
of what you will create\\
with me in the future.\\

Lord, help me see that\\
labels that are chosen\\
are no less limiting than\\
those that are imposed,

And what I am is\\
far less important\\
than what I can be\\
by the grace of God.

/Amen/
