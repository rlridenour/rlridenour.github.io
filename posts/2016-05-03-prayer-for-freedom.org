#+title: Prayer for Freedom

Almighty God,

Free us from the prisons\\
that we have built\\
with the bricks of\\
our own expectations,\\
trapped in cells\\
with invisible walls\\
that confine us only\\
because we let them.

Deliver us from the temptation\\
to trap others by presuming\\
to know your will for them,\\
and forgive us for the arrogance\\
of thinking that we could ever\\
constrain you with limits\\
on what you can do,\\
who you can save,\\
and who you might call.

In the name of Christ,\\
the one who gives freedom\\
to all who truly seek it,

/Amen/
