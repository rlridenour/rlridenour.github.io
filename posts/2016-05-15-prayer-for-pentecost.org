#+title: Prayer for Pentecost

God of Pentecost,

We seek the burning\\
bush in the desert\\
of our existence,\\
never expecting that\\
the fire that drew Moses\\
might fall from heaven\\
into our very own lives.

Holy Spirit, come again\\
to a fragmented people,\\
so that we may speak\\
with one voice of the\\
unending love of God.

/Amen/
