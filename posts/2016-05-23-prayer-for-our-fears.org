#+title: Prayer for Our Fears

God of hope and joy,

You are with me,\\
and in your presence,\\
I will not be afraid

of the world,\\
for it is your creation;

of the future,\\
for you have already redeemed it;

of the unknown,\\
for surely you have seen it;

of the stranger,\\
for she was made in your image,

of my weakness,\\
for you will give me strength.

of the darkness,\\
For I carry the light with me.

You are there,\\
and I am not alone.

I will not be afraid.

/Amen/
