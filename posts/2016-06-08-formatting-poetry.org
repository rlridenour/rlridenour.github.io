#+title: Formatting Poetry

I have been browsing [[http://jekyllrb.com/][Jekyll]] themes lately,
and found a very nice theme for academics, the [[http://elotroalex.github.io/ed/documentation/#bibliographies][Ed. Theme]]. Its main purpose seems to be publishing classic texts and poetry on the web, and it includes some very handy tools.

Getting indentation right is a problem with poetry on the web. For example, consider these lines from "The Codeâ€”Heroics" by Robert Frost.

Here is the Markdown source:


#+begin_example  markdown
What was there wrong?
		     Something you said just now.
What did I say?
	       About our taking pains.


Even though it contains the proper indentation, it renders like this:

What was there wrong?
		     Something you said just now.
What did I say?
	       About our taking pains.
#+end_example

Now, stripping out extra whitespace is generally a good thing, but I don't want it to happen with poetry. With help from the CSS in the .Ed theme, I can get the indentation right.


#+begin_example  markdown
- What was there wrong?
- {:.indent-10}Something you said just now.
- What did I say?
- {:.indent-6}About our taking pains.
{:.poetry}
#+end_example


Ed. sets poetry as an unordered list, with each line as a list item. List style is set to "none" and the indented lines contain an "indent-x" attribute. This produces these properly indented lines:

#+begin_example  markdown
- What was there wrong?
- {:.indent-10}Something you said just now.
- What did I say?
- {:.indent-65}About our taking pains.
{:.poetry}
#+end_example

Ed. also contains formatting tools for bibliographies. It's built on [[https://github.com/poole/lanyon][Lanyon]], the theme that I use, so it was easy for me to just add the CSS that I wanted to my existing site.
