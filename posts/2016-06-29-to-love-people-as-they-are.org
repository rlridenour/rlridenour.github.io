#+title: To Love People As They Are

God of grace,

You stand and knock,\\
not demanding that we come to you,\\
asking only that we open our hearts\\
that you may come to us.

Help me, likewise,\\
to love others just as\\
you have loved me â€”\\

Where they are,\\
and as they are,\\
not how I want\\
them to be.

/Amen/
