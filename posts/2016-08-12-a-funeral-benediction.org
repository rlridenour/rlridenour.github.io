#+title: A Funeral Benediction

This is the benediction from a funeral service that I officiated today:

In our blindness,\\
may the light of God\\
keep us from stumbling.

In our sorrow,\\
may the hand of God\\
dry our tears.

In our questions,\\
may the grace of God\\
be enough, until that day\\
that we know fully,\\
even as we are fully known.

Now, may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,\\
the love of the Father,\\
and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit\\
be with you all,\\
now and forever.

/Amen/
