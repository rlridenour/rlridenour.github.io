#+title: The Eyes of Faith

Creator God,

I gaze out from my fortress,\\
and see a dangerous, hostile place,\\
with dangers on all sides,\\
forcing me to defend my territory\\
against my many enemies.

Sometimes, I see a cold, unfeeling place,\\
that demands that I care only for myself,\\
since no one else will care for me.

Tell me what I would see, Lord,\\
if only I could replace these\\
grimy panes of doubt and fear,\\
and see your creation through\\
the clear windows of hope and love.

/Amen/
