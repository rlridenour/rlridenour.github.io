#+title: Planting a Tree

God of Hope,

I plant this tree in faith,\\
trusting in your gracious care.

If such a slender trunk\\
can weather the Oklahoma wind,\\
then surely we too can weather\\
these storms of our own making.

May our roots reach down\\
into your sustaining love,\\
our branches reach out\\
to shelter those in need,\\
then reach up to the heavens\\
to bid your Kingdom come,\\
and your will be done.

/Amen/
