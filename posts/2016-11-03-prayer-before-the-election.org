#+title: Prayer Before the Election

A prayer for the days preceding the election:

God of comfort,

No matter the result,\\
Half of us will find\\
That the thing we fear\\
Will have come true.

Calm our fears,\\
And restore our faith.

Cleanse our despair,\\
And give us hope.

Banish our anger,\\
And renew our love.

Remind us once again\\
That the Spirit who unites us\\
Is greater than anything\\
That could ever divide us.

/Amen/
