#+title: Hands that Crucify

Lord of all,

What are these hands\\
that they should seize\\
what is offered as a free gift?

What are these hands\\
that they should grasp\\
what should be shared?

What are these hands\\
that they should clench in anger\\
at the thought that you\\
would ever bless anyone else?

What are these hands?

Just the hands of one\\
who would once again\\
crucify the Christ.

A sinner,\\
lost but for\\
the grace of God.

/Amen/
