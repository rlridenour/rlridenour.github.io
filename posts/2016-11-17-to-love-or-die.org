#+title: To Love or Die

#+begin_verse
All I have is a voice\\
To undo the folded lie,\\
The romantic lie in the brain\\
Of the sensual man-in-the-street\\
And the lie of Authority\\
Whose buildings grope the sky:\\
There is no such thing as the State\\
And no one exists alone;\\
Hunger allows no choice\\
To the citizen or the police;\\
We must love one another or die.

Defenseless under the night\\
Our world in stupor lies;\\
Yet, dotted everywhere,\\
Ironic points of light\\
Flash out wherever the Just\\
Exchange their messages:\\
May I, composed like them\\
Of Eros and of dust,\\
Beleaguered by the same\\
Negation and despair,\\
Show an affirming flame.
