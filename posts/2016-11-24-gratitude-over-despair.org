#+title: Gratitude Over Despair

This prayer is from 2014, but somehow seems fitting again this year:

Gracious God,

In the events of this year,\\
we see how fragile our lives truly are.

Daily, we are faced with a choice\\
to be people who live in cynicism and despair,\\
or people who live in gratitude and thanksgiving.

On this day, we choose gratitude over despair,\\
and lift our hearts in thanksgiving to you,\\
the one who is the source of all good things.

Thank you\\
for family and friends,\\
for life and for love,\\
and for the beauty that we would see\\
if we would just open our eyes to you.

/Amen/
