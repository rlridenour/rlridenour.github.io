#+title: The Frailty of Love

Love left its throne,\\
to join us in our\\
weakness and frailty,\\
divine majesty\\
in a helpless babe,

To walk,\\
and laugh,\\
and cry\\
with us,

To show us what love\\
was willing to risk\\
for our sake.

And no matter\\
how much we tried,\\
even we could not\\
destroy its power.

Today, may love again\\
walk with my feet and\\
speak through my mouth.

/Amen/
