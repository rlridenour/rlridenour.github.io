#+title: Prayer for Advent 4

Father of Light,

The creator of the universe\\
came to us as a helpless child,\\
reminding us that there is no\\
reconciliation without risk\\
or love without a chance of loss.

But we sacrificed peace\\
on the altar of security,\\
preferring to remain in darkness\\
than to venture out into the light,\\
desiring our kingdom more than yours.

Give us the courage\\
to drop our guard,\\
and open our lives\\
both to you and\\
to one another.

/Amen/
