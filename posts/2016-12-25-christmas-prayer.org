Who am I this Christmas Day?

Am I an angel, bringing good news to those who yearn to hear it?

Am I a shepherd, who runs to see what God has done?

Am I a Magi, willing to give any gift to the King?

Am I Joseph, listening to any way that God might speak?\\

Am I Mary, saying yes when others would jeer?

In the moments of stillness,\\
when all pretensions are dropped,\\
I fear that I may be Herod,\\
safe and comfortable,\\
but afraid of what might change.\\

Lord, you know my true self,\\
both what I am\\
and what I can be,\\
by your grace.\\

/Amen/
