#+title: The Sin of Ambivalence

Holy God,

The greatest tragedy\\
is not to hate God,\\
for the one who hates\\
has God ever present\\
before his mind.

It is ambivalence,\\
thoughtless and uncaring,\\
a life that is at once\\
both full and empty,\\
full of trivialities,\\
yet empty of meaning

Heal my lukewarm heart, Lord,\\
and restore me to my first love.

/Amen/
