#+title: Prayer in Times of Change

Gracious God,

We live in a time of change,\\
sometimes inspiring and exciting,\\
sometimes distressing and frightening,\\
but always challenging.

Yet even in the midst of upheaval,\\
we can be sure of this:

The Father still loves us,\\
the Son still calls us,\\
The Spirit still leads us,\\
and we must still follow â€“\\

Together,\\
one body,\\
one faith.

/Amen/
