#+title: Prayer for the Fight


We thank God\\
that we are not\\
like the ones\\
who fight\\
with violence\\
and bloodshed.

Instead, we fight\\
with words and images,\\
tweets and memes,\\
dollars and budgets.

The weapons are different,\\
but the pain is just as real.

Lord,

If we are to fight,\\
may we fight for something\\
worth fighting for,

Not our ideologies,\\
nor our egos,

But for what is right,\\
and for those who have no voice.

/Amen/
