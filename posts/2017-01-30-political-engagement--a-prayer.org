#+title: Political Engagement â€” a Prayer

Lord, hear my prayer.

For saying that something needs to be done\\
while refusing to do anything myself,\\

/Lord, have mercy./

For believing that cries of outrage\\
were the same as acts of love,

/Lord, have mercy./

For letting my own ego keep me from\\
reaching out to those with whom I disagree.

/Lord, have mercy./

For pretending that loving humanity\\
was the same as loving my neighbor,

/Lord, have mercy./

/Amen/
