#+title: Give Me Words of Grace

Thinking a lot about the power of language this week. Here's my prayer for the week:

In arrogant blindness,\\
I fail to see that\\
what does not offend me\\
may still be offensive\\
to those around me.

Our words are keys,\\
with the power to\\
both lock and unlock.\\
They can open doors\\
to future conversations\\
or close them forever.\\
They can be vehicles of grace\\
or weapons of hate and destruction.

Help me choose grace.

/Amen/
