#+title: Prayer for Ash Wednesday

Holy God,

Shall this year be like the past,\\
giving up that which brings joy,\\
so that my self-imposed poverty may be\\
a sign of spiritual superiority?

Instead, Lord,\\
by your grace,\\
may I give up\\
bitterness, arrogance,\\
animosity, and the\\
unwarranted certainty\\
that keeps me from\\
loving my neighbor.

Cover me with your ashes,\\
and raise me again\\
to walk anew\\
in your kingdom.

/Amen/
