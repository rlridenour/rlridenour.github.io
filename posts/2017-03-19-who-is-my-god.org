#+title: Who Is My God?

Does my God\\
love only what I love,\\
and hate only what I hate?

If so, then who is my God?

Does my God\\
demand nothing of me\\
that I don't want to give?

If not, then what value is this grace?

Lead me away from the\\
altar of my convenience,\\
and teach me once again\\
what it means to love you.

/Amen/
