#+title: The Betrayer

With a kiss,\\
Judas gave his Lord\\
one last chance to be\\
the Messiah of Judas' dreams.

Am I no better than Judas,\\
when I twist the words of the Lord\\
and manipulate them for my own purposes?

Willing to betray the Lord,\\
and for what?

Not even thirty pieces of silver.

Lord, have mercy.

/Amen/
