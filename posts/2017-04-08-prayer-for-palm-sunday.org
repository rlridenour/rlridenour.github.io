#+title: Prayer for Palm Sunday

Holy God,

Examine my thoughts\\
on this Palm Sunday.

Does my Jesus...\\

Want the very same things I want?\\
Love only the same people I love?\\
Hate all of the same people I hate?\\
Have an agenda that fits too easily into my own agenda?\\
Never say anything that makes me uncomfortable?\\

If so, then what is the object of my worship?\\
Is it a god of my own creation,\\
or is it the God who created me?

Test my heart, O Lord,\\
and may my innermost desires\\
be made transparent,

Even to myself.

/Amen/
