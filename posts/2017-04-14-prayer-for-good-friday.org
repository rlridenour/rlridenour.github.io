(Mosaic: /Carrying the Cross of Christ/ by Gabriel Loire)[fn:1]

It is a sign\\
that we cannot\\
really understand\\
what it means\\
for God to die,\\
that we remember\\
this day when\\
truth and beauty\\
hung upon a cross\\
and we call it good.

What our minds cannot comprehend,\\
our words cannot express.

So, we can do nothing\\
but stand in silence\\
before the glory\\
and the horror\\
of the cross.

/Amen/
