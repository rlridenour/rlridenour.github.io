"Who is it you are looking for?"\\
is a question for me,\\
not just for Mary.

Mary looked at Jesus, and saw the gardener.

I look at my\\
neighbor, and see a stranger;\\
a stranger, an see an antagonist;\\
an antagonist, and see an enemy.

Help me, Lord, to see you,\\
wherever, and whoever, you are.

/Amen/
