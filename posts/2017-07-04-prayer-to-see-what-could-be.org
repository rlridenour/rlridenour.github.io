#+title: Prayer to See What Could Be

God of Love,

When I see a stranger,\\
do you see a beloved child?

When I see an enemy,\\
do you see a friend?

May I see what is,\\
and not what I fear might be.

Even more,\\
may I see what could be,\\
if I were to give even a fraction\\
of the grace that I have received.

/Amen/
