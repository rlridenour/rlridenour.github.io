God of compassion,

There are times when it\\
seems impossible to give thanks,\\
for the loss is too recent\\
and the pain is too great.

But in this, we have hope,\\
That even in the darkest valley,\\
we are not alone, for you are there

And our hope is not in vain,\\
for we see your presence in\\
the church, the body of Christ,\\
which walks beside us.

Give us the grace and love\\
to maintain this community,\\
so that our hope may be proclaimed,\\
again, and again, and again,\\
until that day when Christ himself\\
will wipe every tear from every eye.

/Amen/
