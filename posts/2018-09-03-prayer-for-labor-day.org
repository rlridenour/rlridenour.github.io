Father, We pray for those who labor, For those who are blessed\\
to do what they love, For those who do what they must\\
in order to simply survive. For those with hands as rough\\
as the son of a carpenter, For those with backs as bent\\
as the one who bore a cross\\
through the streets of Jerusalem, And for those who have been\\
shamed, despised and humiliated,\\
while serving at earthly tables,\\
patiently and humbly waiting\\
for a seat at the heavenly banquet. 

/Amen/
