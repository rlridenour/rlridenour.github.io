I switched from latexmk to [[https://mirrors.concertpass.com/tex-archive/support/arara/doc/arara-quickstart.pdf][arara]] for compiling \(\LaTeX\) files. I like being able to embed the compilation steps into the document. That way, I can run the same command to compile, but use PDFLaTeX on some and LuaLaTeX on others. Org mode's export to PDF uses latexmk, though. I think I managed to set it to arara with this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-latex-pdf-process '("arara %f"))
#+end_src
