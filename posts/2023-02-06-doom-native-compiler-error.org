For those of us who live in Emacs, it's always a bad feeling when Emacs won't start, which happened to me today after upgrading my office Mac. I ran =doom doctor= which ran through a few checks and stopped with 

#+begin_src shell
There was an unexpected runtime error
    Message: Native compiler error
    Details: ((lambda (arg106 &optional arg107 arg108) (let (...) (funcall f arg106 arg107 arg108))) "Compiling /Users/rlridenour/.emacs.d/.local/cache/eln/28.2-75f7b60d/subr--trampoline-72657175697265_require_0.eln...\nxcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun\nlibgccjit.so
#+end_src

followed by a bunch of incomprehensible (to me) nonsense. The important part being

#+begin_src shell
invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools)
#+end_src

I always forget that upgrading the OS usually necessitates upgrading the Command Line Developer Tools, so 

#+begin_src shell
xcode-select --install
#+end_src

fixed everything.
