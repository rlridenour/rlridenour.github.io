I've been tempted to do this for years, but have just now transitioned from Hugo to a pure Org mode blog. The process went much more smoothly than I expected, although I still need to convert old Markdown posts to Org mode. That will have to wait until the semester ends. I'll write something soon explaining the transition.

The site is still found at [[https://randyridenour.net][randyridenour.net]].
