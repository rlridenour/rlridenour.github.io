My logic textbook this semester uses a dot for "and" instead of an ampersand. Unfortunately, the center dot in LaTeX is too small to be easily legible. I managed to increase the size of the LaTeX cdot by using the bm package and renewing the command to  =\bm{\cdot}=. In some cases, such as social media and the web, it's easier to use a unicode symbol. Here are the obvious options:

- Dot Operator :: (A ⋅ B)
- Bullet Operator :: (A ∙ B)
- Bullet :: (A • B)

The bullet seems slightly more legible. Here's how it looks in a more complex formula:

#+begin_center
∼[A • (B ∨ C)] ⊃ (B • ∼D)
#+end_center

I don't see any downside to using the bullet.

#+begin_tagline
