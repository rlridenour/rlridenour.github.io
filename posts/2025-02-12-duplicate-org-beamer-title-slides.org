#+TITLE: Duplicate Org Beamer Title Slides

I recently noticed two problems with my LaTeX Beamer lecture slides that I create using Org mode. First, I suddenly had duplicate title slides. My template began with this:

#+begin_src org
,*** 
\maketitle
#+end_src

Deleting that fixed the problem. I guess it just automatically inserts a title slide now. Second, my section and subsection slides weren't being created. Looking at the =*.tex= file showed that the sections were using the =section*= variant. Telling the org file to number the sections fixed the problem. Here's the line to use:

#+begin_src org
,#+OPTIONS: num:t
#+end_src

Modifying my [[https://github.com/rlridenour/beamer-themes][Beamer theme]] also fixed the problem. Evidently, it's pretty simple to specify what should be done with the starred sections in this way:

#+begin_src latex
\AtBeginSection[<text for starred sections>]{<text for unstarred sections}
#+end_src 


#+begin_tagline
Tagged:  [[File:../tags/org.org][Org]] [[File:../tags/LaTeX.org][Latex]]
#+end_tagline
