#+TITLE: Creating an RSS Feed

I struggled with ox-rss for my blog feed and really could never get it working. It would generate an RSS file, but for some reason, the feed readers wouldn't get anything. I don't know enough about XML to fix it, and I had neither the time right now nor the inclination to learn.

So, I stumbled across [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/webfeeder][Emacs Webfeeder]], which creates a feed from the HTML files. After adding it with use-package, I removed the RSS component of my =publish.el= file, and changed by blog build function to this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun orgblog-build ()
    (interactive)
    (progn
      (find-file "~/sites/orgblog/publish.el")
      (eval-buffer)
      (org-publish-all)
      (webfeeder-build "atom.xml"
		       "./docs"
		       "https://randyridenour.net/"
		       (let ((default-directory (expand-file-name "./docs")))
			 (remove "posts/index.html"
				 (directory-files-recursively "posts"
							      ".*\\.html$")))
		       :title "Randy Ridenour"
		       :description "Blog posts by Randy Ridenour")
      (kill-buffer))
    (message "Build complete!"))
#+end_src


After building the site, Webfeeder generated an =atom.rss= file, and everything works fine. That was the last critical component of my endeavor to blog with Emacs only.
