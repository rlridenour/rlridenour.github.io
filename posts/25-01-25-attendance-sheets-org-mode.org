This is another one of those days when I realized that I have been doing things the hard way. For years, I have been generating attendance sign-in sheets with Org Mode wonderful table editor. I would split the names into two columns and add a signature column after each. To ensure there was enough room for the signature, I would then stretch the signature column by adding phantom text to one of the rows like this (the names are from [[https://1000randomnames.com][1000randomnames.com]]):

#+begin_src org
  | Miley Malone | \phantom{xxxxxxxxxx} | Ruben Espinosa | \phantom{xxxxxxxxxx} |
#+end_src

Then, to make sure there was enough vertical space, I would add some extra blank rows between each row, having to adjust several times to make everything fit. It worked fine once completed, but it was certainly a pain in the neck. After seeing Matt Maguire's post, [[https://www.teachmaths.org/20250117_orgmode-tables/][Exporting Org Mode Tables to LaTeX]], I realized there had to be a better way. 

Using the LaTeX [[https://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/tabularray/tabularray.pdf][tabularray]] package, I can simply do this:

#+begin_src org
,#+ATTR_LATEX: :environment tblr :align hline{3-Z}={solid},row{2-Z}={f,12mm},colspec={XXXX}
| *Name*         | *Signature* | *Name*         | *Signature* |
| Miley Malone   |             | Ruben Espinosa |             |
| Braylee Brandt |             | Naomi Warren   |             |
| Abel Bullock   |             | Winnie Weaver  |             |
| Tucker Sexton  |             | Ellen Hayden   |             |
| Leroy Skinner  |             | Damir Phillips |             |
#+end_src

to produce:

#+begin_center
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100% :height
[[../images/posts/tblr-attendance.png]]
#+end_center

Here is what the values of =align= do:

- Ordinarily, =hline= puts a border line on the top and bottom of every row. I don't want them on the first row, so =hline{3-Z}={solid}= omits the first two lines.
- =row{2-Z}={f,12mm}= aligns the text to the bottom of the row and sets the row height to 12mm for all of the rows except for the first.
- =colspec={XXXX}= widens the row to the length of the line. Since the signature columns are blank, I don't really need to specify particular column widths. 

Now, instead of inserting and deleting rows and setting horizontal lines manually, I can just adjust the row height as needed by changing one number. See the excellent tabularray documentation for other settings.
