#+TITLE: Duplicate Org Beamer Title Slides

I recently noticed two problems with my LaTeX Beamer lecture slides that I create using Org mode. First, I suddenly had duplicate title slides. My template began with this:

#+begin_src org
,*** 
\maketitle
#+end_src

Deleting that fixed the problem. I guess it just automatically inserts a title slide now. Second, my section and subsection slides weren't being created. Looking at the =*.tex= file showed that the sections were using the =section*= variant. Telling the org file to number the sections fixed the problem. Here's the line to use:

#+begin_src org
,#+OPTIONS: num:t
#+end_src

#+begin_tagline
Tagged:  [[file:../tags/org.org][Org]] [[file:../tags/LaTeX.org][LaTeX]]
#+end_tagline
